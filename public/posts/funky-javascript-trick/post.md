Ha! [Tuhoojabotti](https://canihasablog.blogspot.com/) just informed me of this neat little trick. If you are on Firefox stick the following into the address bar and hit enter.

<!-- more -->

`javascript:document.body.contentEditable=true; document.designMode=on; void 0`

Now see that you can move the images about and change the text on the page. No idea why you would want to, but its cool nonetheless.

Thinking about it, I guess this is how google docs works under the hood?
