![](https://www.hud.ac.uk/cms-test/images/logo2.gif)Just got a letter through the post confirming the date for my graduation from Uni. <o:p></o:p>

Also at the same time I received a letter informing that I received an award for "Best Overall Performance on the Final Year of the Computer Games Programming Course" which is probably the longest name for an award in history but im still proud :D<o:p></o:p>

Jump to part two after the 26th November to see photos of the ceremony!<o:p></o:p>
