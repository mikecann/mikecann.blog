This is one of my more reccent images and is as allways and experiment. I was experimenting with the types of effects you can get with particles in lightwave. After i created that the whole image seemed to pan out into this thing. I think i envisioned a series of rings that may create a "warp tunnel" effect.

Used: Lightwave 7.5, Photoshop 7
