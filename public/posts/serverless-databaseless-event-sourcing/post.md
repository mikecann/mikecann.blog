title: Serverless & Databaseless Event Sourcing
---

What I was first introduced to Event-Sourcing while [at Bamboo](/posts/started-at-bamboo) it blew my mind and since then I have been fascinated with the possibilities for the technology and have always had the desire to build another Event Sourced app in the back of my mind.

So when I heard about Cloudflare's new Durable Object tech I decided to see if it was possible to create an Event Sourced system that leverages this very interesting platform.

# Video

This post is a little different than usual. Instead of subjecting you the reader to a wall of boring text I decided to create a Youtube video instead which I personally think is easier to digest.

So if you want to see what this project is all about then check it out below:

If you would like to dig a little deeper into how it all works all the source is available on Github here: https://github.com/mikecann/clouds-and-edges

I also put together a miro board for this project here which goes over some of the high-level structure: https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lq_d2nE=/

Let me know in the comments what you think!
