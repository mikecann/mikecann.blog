title: Serverless & Databaseless Event Sourcing
---

3 years ago while [working at Bamboo](/posts/started-at-bamboo) I was introduced to the concept of [Event Sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) for the first time. The concept of turning the database inside out blew my mind. Since then I have been fascinated with the possibilities for the technology and have wanted to build another Event Sourced app.

When I heard about Cloudflare's new Durable Object tech I decided now was the time to tinker with Event Sourcing once again and to see if it was possible create one in a wholely serverless and databaseless manner.

This post is a little different than usual. Instead of subjecting you to a wall of text, and likely mangling the technical concepts, I decided to create a Youtube video instead. I have done this in the past with [my cube project](https://mikecann.co.uk/posts/the-cube) to great success so even though this project isnt as visually appealing I think it should still be more entertaining than a blog post.

If you would like to dig a little deeper into how it all works all the source is available on Github here: https://github.com/mikecann/clouds-and-edges

I also put together a miro board for this project here which goes over some of the high-level structure: https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lq_d2nE=/

BTW I also submitted this project to the [Cloudflare Developer Challenge](https://blog.cloudflare.com/developer-summer-challenge/), fingers crossed they like it!

Let me know in the comments what you think!
