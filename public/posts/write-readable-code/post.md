title: Write Readable Code! - 30 Years of Experience Condensed (Part 1)
---

This month has been a bit of a slow month due to being up in Broome on vacation for half of it. So I thought I would share a recent video I have done for [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) on code writing best practices, some things I have learnt over [30+ years of coding](/about).

Its kind of a personal video so I think its appropriate for this blog. I titled it part 1 because when I sat down to write it, it ended up getting really large so I have split big chunks out into other videos that I will be making the near future.

Anyways I hope you enjoy it!
