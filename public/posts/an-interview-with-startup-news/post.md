Just a short one today..

A few weeks ago I sat down with Mary Miller-Furesh (with whom I had met [during Startup Weekend when I was working on Tuckr](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/myprojects/tuckr/startup-weekend-perth-2015-tuckr/)) and did an interview for West Australia's [Startup News](https://www.startupnews.com.au/).<!-- more -->

It was a short interview in which I spoke about [Mr Nibbles Forever](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/category/myprojects/mr-nibbles-forever/) and [lamented about my Google Play Banning](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/misc/why-i-probably-wont-be-making-another-mobile-game-ever-again/). I also spoke briefly about what im looking at next and the challenges that startups face in WA.

Anyways you can check it out in full here: [https://www.startupnews.com.au/2016/09/28/a-cautionary-tale/](https://www.startupnews.com.au/2016/09/28/a-cautionary-tale/)
