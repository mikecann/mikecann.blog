Well I had mentioned this in a previous post but I thought I might as well add a separate post for it as its quite a big bit of personal news.

Today was my first day at my new job in Wilmslow (20 mins south of manchester) with a new startup named Playdemic.

I cant say what exactly it is im going to be doing yet but it will be Flash related as usual ;)

I will say however, that I am very excited however about the work and the working environment, im eager to get cracking!
