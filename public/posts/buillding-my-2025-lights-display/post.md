title: Building My 2025 Lights Display
---

Merry Christmas all!

Just a short one today to post a video I made showing how I built my most technical Christmas lights display yet.

I think maybe on reflection it was too technical and not "bright" enough. I think people on the fast moving cruise boat value brightness over all else.

Oh well, I learnt a lot along the way, enjoy the making of video, and see you all in 2026!
