Well as I have announced (rather pointlessly) every time I moved in the past, I thought I would continue the tradition by announcing that I have moved again. This time its back again to my old room in one of my previous flats, The Grand Mancehster.

As I have already done a video of this place, Ill just reuse it:

<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3FRstdlJpHE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

EDIT: It would appear that Youtube have removed the soundtrack to the video, so, while watching this video imagine "[Manson - Wide Open Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NgLV056kB0)" playing in the background ;)
