Ive started testing out a new comments system on the blog.

<!-- more -->

Rather than using the standard comments system supplied by Wordpress I thought I would investigate a reccent popular solution called[ Intense Debate](https://intensedebate.com/home). Its by [Automatic](https://automattic.com/), you know, those clever chappies behind Wordpress, Askimet and Poll Daddy.

Anyways, im hoping it will be alot more user friendy and will encourage more comments! Let me know what you think ;)
