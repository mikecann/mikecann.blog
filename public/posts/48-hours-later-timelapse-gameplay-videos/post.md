title: 48 Hours Later - Timelapse & Gameplay Videos
---

Just made these two videos. One is the timelapse video I took to show my development process and the other is to show off the gameplay for those that cant run flash (Linux) or dont want to actually play the game, just want to see what the fuss is about :P

The timelapse was produced using 2300 ish screenshots, one taken every 60 seconds by Chronolapse.

Enjoy:
