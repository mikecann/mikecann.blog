title: Unity Helpers - Utilities and Extensions for Unity

During the development of my up and coming game I have encountered some snags when developing in Unity so I wrote a number of utilities and extension methods to help out.

<!-- more -->

One such annoyance is the inability to use interfaces in GetComponent() and GetComponents(), so I wrote some extension methods to help with that:

```csharp
using UnityHelpers;

var obj = new GameObject();
obj.AddComponent<MyComponent>();

obj.Has<MyComponent>(); // Returns true or false
obj.Has<IMyComponent>(); // Can also handle interfaces

obj.Get<MyComponent>(); // Returns the first component
obj.Get<IMyComponent>(); // Returns the first component that implements the interface

obj.GetAll<MyComponent>(); // Gets all the components
obj.GetAll<IMyComponent>(); // Gets all the components that implement the interface
```

Another utility is for adding children to GameObjects:

```csharp
using UnityHelpers;

var obj = new GameObject();

obj.AddChild("Mike"); // Creates a new GameObject named "Mike" and adds it as a child

var player = obj.AddChild<Player>("Dave"); // Creates a new GameObject named "Dave" and adds the component "Player" returning it

obj.AddChild(typeof(Player), typeof(Friendly), typeof(AI)); // Creates a new GameObject and adds a number of components
```

There are many other utils and extensions, and more to come.

I have rigorously unit and battle tested these utils and [added them to Github](https://github.com/mikecann/Unity-Helpers) so I can use them in furthur projects. I hope they can be of some use to others too!
