Well as it has now hit the media I guess I can blog about it.

Last week it was announced that my currentÂ employerÂ [Playdemic](https://www.playdemic.com/) wasÂ acquiredÂ by the much larger Redwood City based company RockYou.

This is obviously great news for all concerned and can only lead toÂ furtherÂ greatness as we expand and grow under our AmericanÂ overlordsÂ :)
