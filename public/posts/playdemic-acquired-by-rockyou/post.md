Well as it has now hit the media I guess I can blog about it.

<!-- more -->

Last week it was announced that my current employer [Playdemic](https://www.playdemic.com/) was acquired by the much larger Redwood City based company RockYou.

This is obviously great news for all concerned and can only lead to further greatness as we expand and grow under our American overlords :)
