Another week, another game completed as part of [my three prototype games challenge](/posts/the-three-game-challenge/) ([part one](/posts/the-three-game-challenge-part-1-lateshas-crib/), [part three](/posts/the-three-game-challenge-part-3-the-family-jewels/)) I set myself at the start of this month.

For this one I decided on a type of game that I have been wanting to make for a while, a turn based strategy game. Many moons ago I used to play a J2ME (shudder) game called Ancient Empires. It was a great little game with lots of depth and replayabliltiy and I think it deserved a remake of sorts.

So here is "A Cunning Plan":

You can play the game here:

This game was far more complex to create than [Latesha's Crib](/posts/the-three-game-challenge-part-1-lateshas-crib/) and hence I spent about 43 hours over the last 9 days making this one.

I was able to save some time by reusing parts of the rendering and hopping logic from Latesha's Crib. As usual I used the  [Ash Framework](https://www.ashframework.org/) with Adobe Starling and Feathers. To code the AI for the computer player I used [Tim Conkling's Excellent Godmode Behaviour Trees](https://github.com/tconkling/godmode-as3) library which is truly an excellent AS3 library. The way Behaviour Trees work is really cool, I strongly recommend checking them out if you are going to design any sort of AI.

Special thanks go to [Mike Rigby](https://www.facebook.com/mikepaulrigby) for helping with play testing and [Ian Callaghan](https://www.facebook.com/ian.t.callaghan) for suggesting I check out Behaviour Trees :)

Let me know what you think of it, if people are feeling it then I may turn it into a full-blown mobile game!
