Well it may have taken two weeks longer than [my original plan](/posts/lets-make-a-mobile-game-in-3-weeks-with-haxe-nme/) but I can say that after five weeks of development the game is pretty much complete.

<!-- more -->

All 30 levels have been finished, all the menus are in, all the game play elements and artwork are in. The only thing outstanding really is some better sound effects which I plan to put together tomorrow.

So unlike in my previous development posts where I have provided a playable version of the game in the post I have decided instead to hold off till the game is 100% complete before uploading it. I have also grabbed [www.mr-nibbles.com](https://www.mr-nibbles.com/) as a place for the web version of the game to live.

So a short post this one, this week will be about packaging the gameÂ togetherÂ and submitting to the various stores.

Before I go tho here are the three stages in the game, showing off the awesome artwork of myÂ colleagueÂ Moh:
