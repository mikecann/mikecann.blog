Last week the guys over at the excellent [Pixel Sift](https://pixelsift.com.au/episodes/) reached out and asked if I would like to do an interview with them for their Podcast. So we had a short chat about Mr Nibbles Forever, PC publishing and the [Credit Redeemer debacle](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/misc/why-i-probably-wont-be-making-another-mobile-game-ever-again/).

If you like what you heard I strongly recommend that subscribe to the [Pixel Sift podcast](https://pixelsift.com.au/episodes/) they are definitely in my "Must Listen" group of podcasts.
