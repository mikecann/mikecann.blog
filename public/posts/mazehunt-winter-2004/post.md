<span>This is another little project i did in the earlier part of my second year at university. It was my second project i ever did in DirectX and as such is rather limited.

The theme of the project was maze generation and AI solving. I developed my own algoritm based on square weighting to create two bots, one called a hunter bot which will actively hunt the player down, and a flee bot which will flee from the player.</span>

Used: Microsoft Visual Studio .NET (DirectX 9c), 3DS Max <span>\*\*
