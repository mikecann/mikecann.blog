I have immense respect for some of the flash developers out there and Quasimondo is one of them. He has just released a little particle related experiment.<!-- more -->

Whenever I see these kind of things it inspires me to bash out my own little experiments.

I wont talk too much about it but check it out on this lab page: [https://incubator.quasimondo.com/flash/galactose.php](https://incubator.quasimondo.com/flash/galactose.php)
