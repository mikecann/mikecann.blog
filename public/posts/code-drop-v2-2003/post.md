![](/wp-content/uploads/Image/codedrop.gif)<font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CodeDrop came about mainly by accident. I wanted to see if i could create a 2D particle explosion effect. After i discovered how easy this was to do i decided to create a whole game around it!</font>

<font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The game is now in its second version, and has many new improvements over the last, check it out, tell me what you think.</font>
