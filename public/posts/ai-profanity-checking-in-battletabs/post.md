title: AI Profanity Checking in BattleTabs
---

AI is definitely all the rage at the moment for very good reasons. Since I first wrote about it in the context of Game Development back [in November](https://mikecann.co.uk/posts/ai-and-the-future-of-game-development) I have been thinking how we can apply the latest advances to one of the thorniest issues we have [in our](https://gangbusters.io/) game [BattleTabs](https://battletabs.io/).

# Problem

Ever since the first version of the game 3+ years ago we have allowed users to name their player. This we feel gives a better sense of ownership and attachment to the game.

A year or so after launch [we introduced the "Custom Fleets" feature](https://mikecann.co.uk/posts/battletabs-ships-and-fleets-update). As part of this feature the user is able to enter a name for their fleet.

Again we feel this creates a stronger feel of attachment to the game and their choices within it. 

Both of these features however opened up a whole host of issues, particularly around profanity.
