Well here is my next flash based offering...

Its called blast out and the idea is its a modern day version of Break Out. You have to bounce the ball around (which you may recognise from Blast Wave ;)) and destroy the terrain to release the particles. You can collect the particles by holding the left mouse to attract them down to your paddle.

This is actually a much smaller version than the "full" game that i wrote. I originally intended to allow users to make thier own levels in-game which they could then share with others. Unfortunately however flash doesnt allow cross-domain file sharing so i had to cut all that beautiful WORKING code out at the last minute :(

Oh well, i think whats left is still pretty good, hope you enjoy it too!
