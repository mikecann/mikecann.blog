Just a quick post to say I have finally moved away from my old hosting on WebFusion and now im on the cheaper (and hopefully) more reliable hosting by [STRATO](https://www.strato-hosting.co.uk/).

Its the first time I have had hosting on a windows machine and I must say I really like it. I feel much more at home on a windows machine, I know where everything is and im more familiar in a graphical OS. I had aÂ coupleÂ of permissions problems related to uploading new images on wordpress but a quickÂ GoogleÂ turnedÂ up this post:

[https://wordpress.org/support/topic/weird-permissions-with-iis7-and-uploaded-images](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/weird-permissions-with-iis7-and-uploaded-images)

ApparentlyÂ WordPressÂ sticks new uploads in the c:windowstemp directory, before it moves them to the usual wp-content folder, so you have to ensure that temporary folder has the correct permissions for IIS_IUSRS too else it wont work correctly when the file is moved to the content folder.

You may also notice that I have decided to give the blog a little face-lift too with a new theme. I decided this time to go for a paid theme, as theyÂ aren'tÂ that expensive (compared to hosting costs) and the quality andÂ customizationÂ with paid themes are go much better thanÂ theirÂ free counterparts. I found it on the excellent [themeforest](https://themeforest.net/) site, the theme is called [PixelPower](https://themeforest.net/item/pixelpower-responsive-html5css3-wordpress-theme/705136).

Anyways if you find any broken links or anything off with the site then let me know!
