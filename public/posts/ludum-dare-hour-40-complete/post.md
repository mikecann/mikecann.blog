Okay well its not quite complete, the waves of enemies could do with some more work but I have my mum coming up from London to visit me in 30 mins so im gonna call it quits here.

<!-- more -->

So, finally it has a name, I have called it "48 Hours Later" :) Its not technically true as I have only had 40 hours to do it, but oh well!

Overall im pretty happy with my first Ludum Dare entry, im very tired right now and have a banging headache, but thats all part of the fun right?

So onto the game. First some shots:

Okay so if you have been following [waaaay back my original intention](/posts/ludum-dare-hour-1/) was to make a game with the same sort of art style as World of Goo but with the game mechanics of Boom Stick. I think I have stayed pretty true to that original idea.

Basically you fight against waves of enemies that floatÂ acrossÂ the screen. There are currently only 10 waves, I would have liked more and with more variety but oh well ;)

The theme of the competition was "Enemies as Weapons". I haveÂ incorporatedÂ that theme by having the enemies drop giblets when they die. You then have a certain amount of time to pick up those giblets and fire them back at the enemies. Enemies as weapons!

So as a disclaimer: im sure the game has many bugs and things, I have run out of time to do much in the way of testing andÂ optimising. If you find any bugs however drop a comment I would love to hear about them as I plan to release this to a few flash portals, so would like to get those bugs fixed ;)

Anyways enough jibber jabber. A few more shots then the game is below:
