Just a short one this month as I have been working super hard with the team on the mobile port of [our game BattleTabs](https://mikecann.co.uk/posts/battletabs-in-7-minutes). But as this is a personal blog I thought I would share something I think is quite cool.

I have recently really been into the back-end platform [Convex.dev](https://www.convex.dev/) writing this review on it back in August: https://mikecann.co.uk/posts/tinkering-with-convex then entering the WebDevCody competition and coming third in this post: https://mikecann.co.uk/posts/chatter-craft-collaborative-art-with-just-your-voice.

So when Convex reached out to me a few weeks ago to let me know they were starting a brand new Developer Champion program and would like to invite me to be a part of it I was super excited and signed up immediately.

# What are the benefits?

From the Convex docs on the topic:

- Consistent and transparent AMA with leadership
- Exclusive Convex Champion Swag (coming soon)
- Individual [Stack](https://stack.convex.dev/) feature: Case study, profile or project feature
- Profile featured on a new champions page on [Convex.dev](http://Convex.dev)
- Sponsored trips to conferences if your presentation about Convex is accepted
- Complimentary Professional Plan for one team.
  - $0/month, in perpetuity
  - Up to five team members
  - Not for resale or transfer.
  - Includes only built-in monthly Professional resource limits.

Pretty cool!

# Whats involved?

Straight from Convex's docs on the topic:

- Creating blog posts or videos about Convex
- Attending meetups or conferences to give talks about Convex
- Promoting Convex, only if relevant
- Helping users be successful in the Discord

So what does it mean for me? Not much! Im still going to be focusing 99.9% of my time on Gangbusters but should I decide I want to start giving more talks its awesome that the program is there to help sponsor me if I were to give a Convex talk.

Ill still be writing blog posts on whatever interests me so theres no obligation there.

I really enjoy the power and speed of building things with Convex so no doubt you will be hearing a lot more about Convex powered projects on this blog, stay tuned!
