Well as you can probably tell from my [last](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/art/harmony-html5-procedural-drawing/) few [posts](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/art/more-harmony-creations/), I have been loving the simple browser drawing app called [Harmony](https://mrdoob.com/projects/harmony/). Well, while playing with it I thought to myself, "Is there a reason this cant be done in Flash?". Well this is the answer to my question.

I have called it Scribble and its very basic at the moment, not containing even many of the simple features in Harmony, I do however intend to keep adding to it. So over the course of several weeks I hope to add bit by bit till it becomes a fun little place to Scribble!

Anyways, you can check out the current state of the thing here --&gt; [https://www.mikecann.co.uk/flash/Scribble_v0-1/Scribble.html](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/flash/Scribble_v0-1/Scribble.html)

Splendid!
