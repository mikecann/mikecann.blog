[![head](/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/head2.png)](/posts/post-to-tumblr-v3-13/attachment/head-7/)

Just a quick update to my [Chrome Extension PostToTumblr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/post-to-tumblr/dbpicbbcpanckagpdjflgojlknomoiah?hl=en) this morning to fix a few things and add a couple of features after the large update in v3.12.

<!-- more -->

The change log:

- v3.13 -- 20/01/13

* More one-click options for post state, tags and caption
* New button in the options for resetting Tumblr auth
* New button for formatted posts for posting to draft
* Fixed it so you no longer have a menu on one-click if you only have one blog
* Correct verbs are now displayed in the desktop notifications when posting
* Fixed an issue with white pages if you rename your blog
