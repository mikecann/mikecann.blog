title: Clever Spam Email..
---

Its not often that spam gets through my gmail spam filters but this one did, and its quite ingenious:

Whats clever about it:

1.  It uses my name, and my nickname at that to make it sound more personal
2.  It comes from a real sounding name "Bruce Thomas"
3.  It looks exactly like a standard forward email
4.  The attachment contains the name PDF
5.  It contains the "No virus found in the incoming message" text from AVG
    In short it almost got me, when you are short of time and briefly glance at a mail you may look over things and download and open an attachment without thinking about it.

Anyways, thought I would share ;)
