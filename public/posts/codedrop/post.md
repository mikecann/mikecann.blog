Well i have made a decision, instead of starting 10000 projects and never finishing i have decided instead to do some quick projects and shoot them out the door. So the best way to do this i figure is to make flash games.

So here is my first flash game of a few. Its basically a port of a game i did in the first year of uni in DarkBASIC but with some modifications.

Hope you all enjoy it :)
