Yup thats right a new version of Artificial-Studios... again!

This new shiney reincarnation is a blog powerd by the very fancy [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/)!

The reason for this new version? Well lets just take a quick look at the previous reincarnations...

![artstu1.jpg](https://www.mikecann.blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/artstu1.jpg)
First there was [Artificial Studios V1](https://www.mikecann.blog/ArtificialStudios1/ArtStu.html) ([nointro](https://www.mikecann.blog/ArtificialStudios1/ArtStuMain.html)) pretty as it was, done compleately in flash 6, it was increadibly hard to maintain with much effort for each new thing i wanted to add.

Then there was [Artificial Studios V2](https://www.mikecann.blog/ArtificialStudios2/) again, designed from scratch it was kinda pretty and it was certainly easyier to maintain than the first version, however it was still a nightmare to maintain.

So that leads us to this current version, which is extremely easy to maintain, perhaps its a ltitle less personal as the design is just a template by [Fredrik Fahlstad ](https://www.fahlstad.se/)but I think it still looks good!

Let me know which is your favourite!
