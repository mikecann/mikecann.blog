title: Convex 6 Months In
---

[Its been 6 months](/posts/hello-convex) since I joined Convex as a Developer Experience Engineer so I thought it was about time I gave an update as to what I have ben up to and how I have been finding things.

# What Is Convex Again?

Just as a quick reminder Convex is a developer-focused database and cloud compute platform. Think Firebase, Supabase, AWS one of those and you will be on the right track.

The reason I decided to join them is because [some time ago](https://mikecann.blog/posts/tinkering-with-convex) I fell in love with their solution and [started shilling it](https://mikecann.blog/posts/im-now-a-convex-developer-advocate) at every opportunity I could get.

So when Gangbusters [unfortunately ran out of funding](/posts/hello-convex#whats-happening-to-gangbusters-battletabs) I thought I would push my luck and see if they were willing to take me on despite the fact I was living on the other side of the planet to them.

Well after a few rounds of interviews they decided to take me onboard as as trial.. and well I haven't been fired yet so I think im doing okay :)

# What have I been doing?

When I joined I knew roughly what the role entailed; making content to both attract new developers and help others understand and thrive while working with Convex.

What I didn't know was exactly what content I should be creating.

I started off by writing a few blog posts (Convex calls these stack posts):

- [Convex: The Database that Made Me Switch Careers](https://stack.convex.dev/convex-the-database-that-made-me-switch-careers)
- [Code Spelunking: Uncovering Convex's API Generation Secrets](https://stack.convex.dev/code-spelunking-uncovering-convex-s-api-generation-secrets)
- [6 Tips for improving your Cursor Composer and Convex Workflow](https://stack.convex.dev/6-tips-for-improving-your-cursor-composer-and-convex-workflow)
- [Why Convex Queries are the Ultimate Form of Derived State](https://stack.convex.dev/why-convex-queries-are-the-ultimate-form-of-derived-state)

These were great and I could have continued like this but there were plenty of other folks at Convex that were writing really high quality blog posts that it was proposed that perhaps I would like to start making video content for [their YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@convex-dev) too.

So although I had virtually no experience making educational videos like this I dove in and started creating.

At first the videos were pretty rough..

The lighting was terrible, the framing was bad and the size of the text on the screen is too small. Not to mention the various audio issues and other artifacts.

Over the next few months tho I slowly started to upgrade my setup and process.

Thus far I have created 17 long-form videos and 11 short-form videos and 5 stack posts.

# Things im discovering about myself

So far this position had pushed me way out of my comfort zone. For 6 years while I was working at Gangbusters I was in my happy place just sat in front of a keyboard smashing out the code barely talking or interacting with anyone.

Now I have to try to be much more charismatic and dynamic when in front of the camera. I have to think on my feet and try to explain something clearly but not take a long time about it, also try to keep it entertaining. Its a lot to do and think about when im much more used to taking as much time as I work through a problem.

I keep trying to compare myself to other content creators like [Theo Browne](https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg) or [Web Dev Cody](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevCody) or [Primeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen) but I think I am slowly coming to the realization that I don't think im ever going to be like those guys and thats okay.

Theo's ability to pump out content while also working fulltime is just phenomenal. I am in true admiration how is able to confidently talk and explain something while continuing to keep it entertaining and do it at such a pace that he is able to do a video per day.

I am currently aiming to do 2+ videos per week. My videos are quite varied but they generally involve some sort of research, script writing, coding, filming then editing process.

I generally find the research and coding process fun and comfortable. I should do really as it what I have done for most of my career.

The script writing and filming process however is much more stressful.

The seems to be two schools of thought with this one. Either you script everything and read it back or you just write some minor notes and then ad-lib it.

I don't mind the script writing and reading it back process but there is a nack to it where you want it to sound natural and not like you are reading from a prompter (which I generally am). Its quite hard to do this and its still a work in progress.

The ad-libbing a video however I have found that I end up feeling quite stressed and pressured that im not saying what I wanted to say or am waffling too much or am not sounding sufficiently confident about the topic. This I think is something that I can and probably should improve on. Maybe I should do more public speaking so that I gain much more confidence talking on a topic without an exact script?

# Hows the remote thing going?

Well there are two parts to that question. Hows it going for me and hows it going for Convex?

For me its fine. I'm used to working remote. I've been doing it for the best part of a decade at this point so im comfortable with it.

There are times I kind of wish that I was closer just for the bonding and comradery aspect. It was one thing that I used to love while working at Playdemic back in the UK. Its just that human-to-human contact that is a touch lacking over a Zoom call.

I do try hard to be as social as I can outside of work. Its an effort, I have to really work at it but I feed an anxiety and a hole in my life if I don't. Im not sure if that makes me an extrovert or an introvert ðŸ¤· all I know is, I need it.

Having said that however I don't miss lots of other things such as the commute and other inefficiencies and distractions you get when you are forced to be on site.

As for the work itself I get it that certain positions, particularly in games companies, benefit from being in person. When I was at Playdemic there were lots of times that ideas came about just because I happened to be walking past someones desk and saw what they were working on and had a discussion.

But my role right now seems to be working just fine with me in isolation. Im often able to just work on a video without lots of contact from the rest of the team. Sure there are moments where I am working on something thats not fully finished so there is a bit of back and forth required but hopping on a quick Zoom call is usually all it takes to unblock me.

As for Convex, how have they found things working with me so far away? Im not sure entirely its hard for me to know exactly but I think its been okay. It is likely frustrating for them having to schedule meetings late in their day just so they can catch me in the short window im online in my early morning but I think in the most part its worked out okay.

# Conclusion

I am still regularly pinching myself that I am lucky enough to work for a company I had admired from afar for so long. Being able to work on the cutting edge of the tech that has driven me my whole career is a dream come true.

So although being a video content creator doesn't come naturally to me im going to give it my all and try to continue to improve not only my content production but try to do whatever I can to make Convex succeed.
