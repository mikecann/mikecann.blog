> Alien2 was one of my very early pieces of work. I wanted to create the impression the alien was coming through a misty doorway with light streaming behind him. However at the time i didnt have the technical know-how to achieve this effect and so had to make do with the effect above.

Used: Lightwave 7.5, Photoshop 7
