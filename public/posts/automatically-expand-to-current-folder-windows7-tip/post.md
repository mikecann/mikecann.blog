Forgive me if you already know this but I just discovered it by accident and think its pretty neat.

<!-- more -->

Open a windows explorer window (windows &amp; e) then click on Organise > Folder and Search Options:

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Shot_0021-237x300.png "Shot_002")](/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Shot_0021.png)

Inside here is a nifty little option called "Automatically Expand To Current Folder":

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Shot_001.png "Shot_001")](/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Shot_001.png)

Now you can easily get a view where you are in a folder structure and jump to the sub-folder of your choice!
