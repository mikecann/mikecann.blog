Just thought I would report on a project my friend [Michael Lindholm](https://liero3d.blogspot.com/) has been working on for a while now. Its [Liero but in 3D](https://liero3d.blogspot.com/2011/03/ladys-and-gents.html)! As some of you may know I have dabbled with making a remake of Liero [several times in the past](/posts/lieroxna/).

Anyways, it looks like its coming along nicely. He's gone for a voxel-like engine, with screen space ambient occlusion for shading. Personally I think the effect works really well for the game. Check it out:
