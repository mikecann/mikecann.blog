title: Hello Convex
---

This is just going to be a quick one to say that I'm super excited to announce that I am joining [Convex](convex.dev) as a Developer Experience Engineer!

If you don't know what Convex is then do yourself a favor and [checkout their excellent site](https://www.convex.dev/) and [docs](https://docs.convex.dev/) but in short its â€œa sync platform that replaces your backend and client state management.â€ I half-jokingly describe it as â€œFirebase for adultsâ€

I am super excited about this role as it means I get to do what I love most; tinkering with and producing content about cool technology.

# Why join Convex?

If you have been following along on this blog for the past year or so you will have noticed me be quite effusive about my love for the Convex platform:

- [Tinkering With Convex](https://mikecann.blog/posts/tinkering-with-convex)
- [Chatter Craft - collaborative art with just your voice](https://mikecann.blog/posts/chatter-craft-collaborative-art-with-just-your-voice)
- [Im now a Convex.dev Developer Champion!](https://mikecann.blog/posts/im-now-a-convex-developer-advocate)
- [Whisper Farm - Parallel Transcription](https://mikecann.blog/posts/whisper-farm-parallel-transcription)
- [Mikebot - The Virtual Me](https://mikecann.blog/posts/mikebot-the-virtual-me)

With 17+ years of professional development experience (yes, I'm getting old!) and a blog spanning over two decades, I've explored countless ways to build projects. After all this experience, I genuinely believe Convex is the best platform for building apps.

Beyond the technology, the company itself is exceptional. While it's no surprise that former Dropbox core-tech team members are brilliant, what truly stands out is their character and dedication to building [a fantastic developer experience](https://mikecann.blog/posts/tinkering-with-convex).

# What's happening to Gangbusters & BattleTabs?

I have a detailed explanation for leaving Gangbusters that I'll save for a longer retrospective post. The short version is that the company has run out of money. Unlike when we started 6+ years ago, I now have [a family](https://mikecann.blog/posts/joshua-christopher-cann) and [mortgage](https://mikecann.blog/posts/moving-home-and-startlink) to sustain. I chose not to seek additional funding because, honestly, I'm feeling burnt out from working on the same project for so long.

I want to emphasize my deep respect and admiration for my co-founder [Brandon](linkedin.com/in/thebrandonwu/), whose optimism throughout these 6+ years has been truly inspiring. I have so much to say about how great Brandon was to worth with but I think ill leave that for the retrospective.

We're currently figuring out the future of both the game and the company. We're open to all possibilities, so please reach out to [Brandon](https://www.notion.so/Gangbusters-a-Retrospective-150fd70ecfa0801ca372eeadcbf73658?pvs=21) or [me](https://www.notion.so/10ffd70ecfa0800eaf28d8aa2604be10?pvs=21) if you have any suggestions.

The game's community holds a special place in my heart. While players have come and gone over the years, those who've stayed have been one of my strongest motivations to keep developing this game, I â™¥ï¸ you guys!
