I know this news is a coupple of days old now, but I havent blogged in a little while so I thought why not.

It looks like the new version of Flash (CS5 or Flash player 10.1 however you look at it) [will be supporting compilation to native iPhone apps](https://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashcs5/appsfor_iphone/).

This is fantastic news as I have been interested in doing an iPhone app for some time and have even gone as far as reading the docs and purchasing the Developer program.The stumbling block was the learning curve with Objecive-C. Now tho it seems I should be able to get away with just learning a new nuances with Flash->iPhone.

What does this mean? Well some of my previous games [BlastWave](https://www.mikecann.blog/programming/blastwave-2-development-update/), [IcySlicy](https://www.mikecann.blog/programming/icy-slicy/), [CodeDrop](https://www.mikecann.blog/flash/codedrop/), [BlastOut](https://www.mikecann.blog/programming/blast-out/) would all work well on the iPhone, however I detest simply re-hashing old ideas so likely ill be making a very simple flash game to start off with that will take advantage of all the new inputs the iPhone and Flash10.1 will allow!
