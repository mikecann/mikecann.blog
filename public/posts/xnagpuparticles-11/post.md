title: XNAGPUParticles 1.1
---

I got bored of revision for my final exam so i decided to play around with my XNAGPUParticles abit more and came up with this thing.

<!-- more -->

Basically it takes a texture and picks out pixel colours from the texture and maps it onto a large vertex buffer which then is used as the input to my Vetex Texture particle system.

I have made a few adjustments to the way the vertex texture system works, now each particle has its own centre of gravity that it revolves about.
