I cant believe how well my humble little extension for the chrome browser is doing. [8000 users](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/detail/dbpicbbcpanckagpdjflgojlknomoiah/publish-accepted) when just a few months ago [I was celebrating 1.5k](/posts/posttotumblrs-1628th-user-celebration/).

<!-- more -->

There were so many requests for new features and things that I thought I would push an update out this evening to add a little more functionality.

From the change log:

- v.0.8 -- 19/06/11 --

* Text, Page, and Links are now supported in addition to Images
* Added an app icon to the bar for easy access to the options

To highlight these new changes I decided to update the promo video too:

I have also added a donation button into the options. I have no idea if anyone will click it, an interesting experiment tho.

If you have it installed it should auto-update, if not go grab it over on the chrome app store:Â [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dbpicbbcpanckagpdjflgojlknomoiah](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dbpicbbcpanckagpdjflgojlknomoiah)
