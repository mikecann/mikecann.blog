I have got to be honest, I have never heard of [Web Dev Cody](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevCody) before but when I saw that he had a [hackathon](https://hackathon.webdevcody.com/) in partnership with [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) I knew I was going to have to carve off a bit of time from [BattleTabs](https://battletabs.com/) development to have a crack.

# Competition Categories & Ideation

[![](./categories.png)](./categories.png)

The competition was themed around Collaboration and AI so I racked my brain for a bit before coming up with an idea.

I wont spend too many words explaining what I built, instead ill let the video that I used to demo the project do the talking:

# Results

Out of [53 submissions](https://hackathon.webdevcody.com/submissions), I came third in the AI category which im pretty happy with considering I spent less than a day on it.

Watch Cody talk about my project here:

# Conclusion

I had a ball working on this, its pretty astounding that you are able to build this much functionality in such as short time. I was able to implement and iterate as fast as I could go without any boiler-plate bogging me down.

[Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) really is an incredible technology, if you are looking to do a web app you should definitely check it out!
