![](https://www.mikecann.blog/wp-content/uploads/Image/Cannyshammy.jpg)This little flash movie was created for my old everquest guild when i left the game. Its more of a montage of my time in everquest and is presented as a kinda slideshow. I played the game for 3 years and i still have many fond memories of my time in the game.
