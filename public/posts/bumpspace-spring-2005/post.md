This was a tech demo I created for one of my final projects in my second year of university. Due to the severe time restrictions at the end of the term i wasnt able to do the project i wanted to (ToyTown MMORPG) so insted of trying to struggle and force a large project into a small time frame i decided not to do a MMORPG.

<!-- more -->

Over the year i had seen several nice effects and snippits of code, such as Dot3 Bump Mapping, Particle Effects and Bezier Curves. I decided to have a go at these effects and others myself, the result being this application, it isnt a game but rather a demo of some of my programming skills.

Used: Microsoft Visual Studio .NET (DirectX 9c), 3DS Max
