Finally, finally I have decided to say sod it and stop tinkering with this god damn mix! I have been making and remaking this thing for the best part of a year but I can still see the rough edges. Its been driving me quite literally mad! Having said that however I have enjoyed making it, else I wouldn't do it... right?

Anyway the idea was to have a two part mix, a more downtempo one and this one (coming soon). I have tried to tell a story with this mix, using both samples from a certain famous movie and through the track selection and progression. I have gone for a deeper darker sound than my [usual](https://www.mikecann.blog/?p=87) [harmonics](https://www.mikecann.blog/?p=113) [light](https://www.mikecann.blog/?p=210) and easy to listen to sound. I dont imagine this one will be as popular with most people but I hope some will enjoy it!
