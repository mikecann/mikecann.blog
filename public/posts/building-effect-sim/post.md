Alright another super short one this month, this is the second part to my video explainer for my big christmas lights project that took me most of last year.

As part of that project I ended up building my own software app to build the displays then send data out to the lights.

Im quite proud of what I built here as it includes some quite novel things that I hadnt seen before in other projects.

Its a bit of a long video but I didnt know what to cut out so 🤷 the 3 of you that watch it to the end, I hope you enjoyed it 😅
