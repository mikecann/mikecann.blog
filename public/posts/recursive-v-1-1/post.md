I have found a little more time this evening to fix some bugs and make some improvements to my Chrome extension [Recursive](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/recursive/hbgbcmcmpiiciafmolmoapfgegbhbmcc?hl=en). The changes are as follows:

<!-- more -->

> ----- v.1.1 ------
>
> - Now only displays recursive icon on tabs with https:// and https://
> - Full screen now works (uncommented that line of code, doh!)
> - Pause and reseting a recurse now works correctly
> - Renamed the title page of the app
> - Some Performance improvments
> - There is now an option in the settings to define a custom file filter
> - There is now a setting to disable removing duplicate files

One of the main new additions is the ability to add a custom filter in the settings which recursive uses when parsing a file:

If any are found they are then displayed in the files dialog:

As I say, just a quick update this evening. I plan on writing some more in-depth blog posts this week explaining some of the nuts and bolts of Recursive.
