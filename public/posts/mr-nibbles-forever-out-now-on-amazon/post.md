Just a quick one to let you know that Mr Nibbles Forever is now [available to download on your Amazon device](https://www.amazon.com/Epic-Shrimp-Mr-Nibbles-Forever/dp/B016UN4K0G/ref=sr_1_1?s=mobile-apps&ie=UTF8&qid=1446166028&sr=1-1&keywords=mr+nibbles+forever)!

This was a bit of a longshot as there aren't too many Amazon devices out there but it was a low-hanging fruit as there wasnt too much needed to make the Android build work, just a new IAP system and thats about it.

Im thinking about doing a web version of the game too, what do you think?
