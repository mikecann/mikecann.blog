            <description><![CDATA[
Quite some time ago now a good friend and fellow squash player shared an idea he had with me, to create a system that is able to track a squash ball during a game and project realtime information onto the back wall.

Its an idea that really resonated with me and I have been thinking about it ever since. I want to share my thoughts here and see if anyone else has ideas on how to tackle this thorny problem.

            <description><![CDATA[
Well its been years in the planning and months in the development but the "Big Summer Update" / "Seasons" / V1 update for our game [BattleTabs](https://battletabs.com) is finally out!

This is by far our biggest update yet. We generally don't like making large changes to the game like this, preferring small frequent incremental changes but it was necessary however as there are lots of exciting new overlapping systems and features in this update!

            <title><![CDATA[Serverless & Databaseless Event Sourcing]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[
3 years ago while [working at Bamboo](/posts/started-at-bamboo) I was introduced to the concept of [Event Sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) for the first time. The concept of turning the database inside out blew my mind. Since then I have been fascinated with the possibilities for the technology and have wanted to build another Event Sourced app.

When I heard about Cloudflare's new Durable Object tech I decided now was the time to tinker with Event Sourcing once again and to see if it was possible create one in a wholely serverless and databaseless manner.

            <description><![CDATA[
My PC is awesome but it has a bit of an addiction to Watts. So I wanted to build a low-powered NAS and Plex server so when I put PC asleep at night I can still enjoy some quality time with my content on the TV downstairs. Since I had a spare Raspberry Pi 4 glaring at me from my desk I thought, sure why not, how hard could it be?

Back in in the before-times of May 2020 OpenAI made a [stunning announcement](https://openai.com/blog/tags/announcements/) about the capabilities of their latest project named GPT3. When I saw [what it was capable of](https://beta.openai.com/) and it was going to be turned into an API I knew I was going to have to tinker with it!

When I was sent a replacement for my broken [Versa 1](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products/smartwatches) by Fitbit they decided to upgrade me to a Versa 2. This was great except it meant that the watch face I was using before no longer worked and I was unable to find a good replacement so I thought it was time to get my hands dirty and code one up myself.

I have generally steered away from building open-source libraries mainly for selfish reasons (I didn't want to spend the time maintaining them) but I decided that the current work I was doing would benefit from input and improvement from others and so I decided to release two things as libraries and im really happy with how things went.

            <description><![CDATA[
I spent a few hours tinkering with the new (alpha release) version of React which includes the new React Hooks feature.

In my [last post](/machine-learning/a-game-developer-learns-machine-learning-a-little-deeper/) we dug a little deeper into machine learning by starting from scratch and training an agent on a vastly simplified version of mr nibbles. In this post we will explore what happens when we step it up a notch and attempt to train on a significantly more complex version of the game.

            <description><![CDATA[
Ever since I was little I have always found it easier to sleep if I have some sort of background noise. For me it quietens the mind, allowing me to concentrate on the familiar sounds instead of those thoughts that seem to always come out right when you want to relax. I like listening to audio books that I have listened to 1000 times before. My brain knows whats coming up in the story but still concentrating on it allows my sub-conscious to quieten and calm down. Its very much like a breathing meditation for me.

After the relaxing couple of weeks in Broome we were back on the road again. The original plan was to head along the Gibbs River road a 660 km long dirt road that has a number of beautiful stops at gorges along the way. We had done it once before in 2014 and enjoyed it so much that we wanted to do it again. This year however was one of the wettest wet season on record, the result is that the road has been closed much longer than usual and many of the gorges have been closed.

After the beautiful but fly-infested Shark Bay I was so happy to get the Exmouth and experience some of the beautiful corals and beaches. Unfortunately however the swimming gods weren't on my side for the 4 days we were here as the entire coast was infested with stinging red jellyfish and deadly Irukandji jellyfish.

Just a quick one and some good news on the nibbles front since the horror story that was my [Google Play debacle](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/misc/why-i-probably-wont-be-making-another-mobile-game-ever-again/).

My PC publisher for Mr Nibbles Forever and good friends over at [Black Shell Media](https://blackshellmedia.com/) have very kindly decided to publish the Android version of [Mr Nibbles Forever to the store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blackshellmedia.mrnibblesforever). This is great news as the game I spent so long developing, working on and promoting is once again available for others to enjoy.

Over the Christmas period Microsoft were running a promotion to developers; "Publish your apps to the Windows store before the 23rd of December and we will give you some Microsoft store credit".

            <description><![CDATA[
[Post To Tumblr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/post-to-tumblr/dbpicbbcpanckagpdjflgojlknomoiah) my popular Chrome extension will be entering its 6th year of continual development this year so I thought it fitting that I give it a much needed overhaul.

It had been long coming, the last major update I gave it was about 1.5 years ago. In that version I moved the backend from Google App Engine over to Parse and I rewrote the frontend to use requireJS and knockoutJS. Although they have served me well, a lot has happened in the past 18 months and maintaining the client code was starting to become painful.

            <description><![CDATA[
So I am taking a little time away from games development at the moment to explore a few other projects and ideas. I want to solve real problems that either I or others have had. I want the projects to be short so I don't get bored and frustrated and I want to also learn new techniques and technologies as I build them.

            <description><![CDATA[
[Over a year ago](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/portfolio/projects/unity-ashteroids-ash-framework-in-unity/) I decided to scratch an itch and see if I could get Richard Lord's Ash framework to work in Unity. It actually turned out to be far easier than I had imagined. A few people contacted me as they wanted to use it for production games so I decided to do [a little more work on it a few months later](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/programming/unity-ash-upgrades/) to fix some of the easily solved issues with my quick port.

Well its been exactly [95 days since my last Alpha release](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/myprojects/mr-nibbles-forever/mr-nibbles-forever-alpha-7/) of my mobile game Mr Nibbles Forever which is far too long. I apologise to people who have been asking me for a new version. I took on a few paid freelance projects a few months ago and they took up a whole bunch of time then I decided to take a full time position up in Perth a month ago which [drastically cut down my Mr Nibbles development time](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/uncategorized/started-work-at-thebroth-in-perth/) sadly.

I didn't do a release last week as I had quite a bit of other work on and so there wasn't all that much progress so I thought I would skip a week.

            <description><![CDATA[
While experimenting around with rotating in more than just one axis I ran into an issue. When rotating you can obscure the camera with the level. It would be possible to construct levels such that they can't be rotate into a position that anything would be obscured but it would severely restrict the number and type of levels I could build.

As mentioned in my [previous post](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/games/taming-unity/) I have been working on a multiplayer game built in Unity for a little while now. I ummed and ahhed over the technology choice for the backend for a little while before deciding to go with [Parse.com](https://Parse.com)'s library. The reason being that it looked simple to implement (they have a Unity SDK), they take care of all the backend headaches for me and the pricing model looked fair.

Along the way I had the good fortune of meeting a [special lady](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/uncategorized/the-trip-2013-guadalajara-to-mexico-city/). We travelled together for 5 months, virtually every second of every single day was spent together.

While I was travelling I have had a great many people contact me about my popular chrome extension [Post To Tumblr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/post-to-tumblr/dbpicbbcpanckagpdjflgojlknomoiah?hl=en). Some wanted me to fix things some wanted me to add things others wanted to buy the extension outright.

In what appears to be an almost annual event I have decided to move hosting of my blog yet again! Im moving away from the £35 per month hosting of 1&amp;1 because although I like the freedom of having my own box that I can remote into i’m just finding it too expensive for me to justify having it. There are so many Platform as a Service (PaaS) options out there that provide high quality hosting cheaply I thought I would switch over....]]></description>

We left our tour group in La Paz and continued on our own for the next week, time was tight as we had to be in Buenos Aires in just a few days to meet final tour group. I knew that no trip to South America is complete without a visit to the salt flats of Uyuni, Bolivia so we crowbared in a 3 day excursion into our schedule.

Im now 6.5 months through my 8.5 month journey and finally reached one of the highlights of my trip, the Inca trail and Macchu Picchu. I have been looking forward to this one for a while, it started off by driving down into the Sacred Valley 1 hour outside of Cusco.

Its been a while since my last update, since then I have crossed into Ecuador from Colombia and traveled hundreds of miles. After my two weeks spent learning to Paraglide in Bucaramanga I was keen to get back on the road again, I had less than a week to make my way over to the coast of Ecuador where I had booked some Kite Surfing lessons.

After 10 days up in the chilly hills I was looking forward to getting down to the coast and enjoying some of the sun and beach again. First up was the ancient colonial town of Cartagena. This place is a dichotomy of poverty and wealth thanks to the large number of western tourists that visit the city.

After our awesome [trip to Tikal](/posts/the-trip-2013-playa-del-carmen-to-tikal/) in Guatamala we returned to our hotel on the lake shore in El Ramate. It had been a long hot day so we relaxed by paddling in the warm waters of the lake.

Before leaving to go on my trip I entered a competition being run by the NHS called "[Social Innovation in Salford](https://www.nwsocialvaluefoundation.org/competition/)". The intention of the competition is to find people with ideas for how to solve some issues currently facing the NHS in the Manchester region.

The next stop after leaving Mexico city was the town of Oaxaca. This town has a much different feel to the rest of the destinations we have visited so far. Gone is the dusty desert, instead it has been replaced by lush tree covered hills.

Its been a while since my last post, the past three weeks spent travelling across Mexico have been an intense non-stop tour of northern and western Mexico. The small amount of downtime we have been afforded has usually been spent catching up on much needed sleep.

Well as announced [in my last post](/posts/my-2013/) im going to be spending most of this year travelling around various parts of the world. I'm leaving on the 7th on May so I have about a month left before I go so I have been thinking on what small project I can do in the meantime to keep me out of mischief.

Just before [leaving Playdemic](/posts/goodbye-playdemic/) we had a company-wide ship-it-day. If you haven't done one of these before they are great and work very similar to game jams like [Ludum Dare](https://www.ludumdare.com/). Basically you have 24 hours to create something related to the company then you have to present it.

[Last October](/posts/try-harder-2012-slides/) I was fortunate enough to attend the excellent [Try Harder](https://www.tryharder.org.uk/) conference for the second time.[ I have spoken before](/posts/try-harder-2012/) about how inspirational the event is where every attendant must give a talk on something they are passionate about. One of the talks was by David Wagner's and was on 'The Value of Tinkering' and it inspired me to[ tinker with TypeScript](/posts/tinkering-with-typescript/) which led to my [Recursive Chrome Extension](/posts/personal-project/recursive/).

Its been quite a while since I last made a mix. The last one [Second Life](https://soundcloud.com/mikecann/artificial-second-life) was a collection of my favorite dubstep and bass tunes at the time. Since then the genre has grown and diversified and other sub-genres have opened up. Im really into some of these new sounds that involve more melody and progression but keep that rough bassey sound that popularizes dubstep.

I have finally found some time to do a long overdue update to my popular Chrome extension [PostToTumblr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dbpicbbcpanckagpdjflgojlknomoiah) built using Haxe. 30,000 people currently have the extension installed and they post about 10,000 images, links, quotes per day so I thought it was about time to give it some love.

Wow, well that took longer than expected! [44 days ago I blogged](/posts/tinkering-with-typescript/) that I had started work on a second version of my Chrome Crawler extension and have only just managed to get it to a state I was happy with enough to release it. To be fair I had been on [a trip to New York](/posts/new-york-new-york/) during that period so perhaps I can be excused. Having said that however I think the time has been well spent and am fairly proud of the result.

I just realised that I still hadn't posted anything about the Haxe conference, WWX 2012, I attended at in February of this year, how lax of me! Well actually I was waiting for the videos to be released so I could give a link to the lightning talk I gave on my WebGL experiments from last year. (Un)fortunately however, the lightning talks weren't recorded so you cant see my nervously mumble through my presentation.

Well its been a couple of weeks since we launched on iOS and a few weeks since Android, so I have decided to write one more post on the Mr Nibbles project. A post mortem into what went right, what went not so right which should hopefully serve to solidify my learning from the process and perhaps help others who should embark on something similar.

Its a lazy sunday so I have decided to do a few chores I have been meaning to do for a while. One of them has been to move some of my old projects over from Google Code over to Github and to begin uploading some of my older projects that are scattered through this blog directly to Github.

As usual you can have a play with the game in its current form above. (Up to jump, left and right to control the player).

The first new thing to notice are there are now menus, yey! Incredibly poor, made by a toddler, looking menus, but menus nonetheless. My artist and collaborator on this project, Moh, has been away for the last week so the game has had to suffer at the hands of my terrible programmer art. Now that he is back however, he will be whipping the visuals into shape....]]></description>

I'm now two weeks into my original 3-week-deadline mobile game project. You can checkout the progress thus far by playing the game above ('up' to jump, 'left' and 'right' to control the player).

Its been a few more days now and quite a bit of progress has been made so I thought I would update. First, have a go at the game in its current form above (use the keyboard to control).

.. and we have progress! See above. Use the keyboard to control the 'player'.

The first thing you will noticed is that there is a world populated with solid blocks and some orange circle things that may look a little like collectables :P To generate this level I decided to take a page out of Notch's book and build the levels at the pixel level in Paint.NET. That way the image editing software becomes the level editor. So as an example, the data that builds the level for above looks like:

            <description><![CDATA[
I have decided that I would like to learn more about mobile game development. Its an exciting area of the games industry at the moment with so many frameworks and languages to choose from to develop with. The plethora of choice however can be a hindrance, what are the best frameworks and language for this particular task? Haxe with NME?  C# MonoTouch with Monogame? or even Javascript with Titanium? One can only go so far just reading about them, eventually you have to jump in and try them out for yourself.

Well since we have made the [decision to discontinue Printomi](/posts/sunsetting-printomi/) I have been backing up the databases and downloading the 90GB+ of images that users have uploaded.

Well it wouldn't be like me if I didn't start thinking about what cool things I do with all those pixels. I remember seeing those [cool Mincraft maps](https://www.deadworkerspartynetwork.com/theshaft/map1/mapalt1/map.html?worldX=980&worldY=0&worldZ=160&zoom=6) that use the Google Maps API to explore the Minecraft servers and it got me thinking if it could be possible to do something like that but for the Printomi images.

I have been meaning to do this for a while, but never gotten round to it. Well more precisely other projects have always been more interesting so I pursued those instead ;) This Christmas however I decided it was about time that I finally did it.

I woke up the other day thinking about Terraria. No idea why as I haven't played it in ages, but its the type of game I really enjoy so it must have snuck into my dreams during the night.

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/head02.png "head02")](/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/head02.png)

For some time now I have been working with WebGL and have developed a sort of love/hate relationship with it. I love the ability to instantly target millions of people with GPU accelerated code without any plugins or barriers (excluding the targets that dont support it). However as a developer, writing code that takes advantage of WebGL kinda sucks.

I have just pushed a few small changes to one of my projects, [Windows Taskbar Monitor](https://code.google.com/p/win7-taskbar-mon/).

One of the users of the app noted that they find it rather annoying having the animated progress bars and asked whether it would be possible to add an option to disable it. I agreed that it could get a little distracting so I added the option to disable the bars.

Following on from [my previous experiments with WebGL](/posts/chrome-crawler-haxe-three-js-webgl-and-2d-sprites/) I decided to give HTML5's Canvas a a look as it was supposed to be designed specifically for the purpose of doing 2D.

Day[9] is a Starcraft2 commentator and a professional gamer (among other things). I have been following him for sometime watching his 'casts' of games. He just posted this video on Youtube (although its an old episode), its an incredibly moving tale of his journey through gaming to becoming one of the top players in the world. More than that he relates it to how his family have supported him through his passion and giving him belief to do what he loves.

Just made these two videos. One is the timelapse video I took to show my development process and the other is to show off the gameplay for those that cant run flash (Linux) or dont want to actually play the game, just want to see what the fuss is about :P

The timelapse was produced using 2300 ish screenshots, one taken every 60 seconds by Chronolapse.

Im not too sure if I have spoken before about Lucid Dreaming. I was interested in the concept several years ago when I first heard about it and then by accidentally managed to do it once while on holiday. It was an incredible experience and ever since the concept of consciously influencing your dreaming state has fascinated me.

Well its been a while since I have made a new mix, but I have been collecting tracks for it for a while. This one came together fairly quickly actually, about two days worth of composition and then a few variations until I was happy with it. I decided not to add any movie samples to this one to keep it nice and simple, got alot of other projects on at the moment! Im not even sure if people actually like those movie samples tho, let me know if you do!...]]></description>

It appears now however that [PlanetBeing ](https://linuxoniphone.blogspot.com/2010/04/ive-been-working-on-this-quietly-in.html)from the Dev-Team has managed to take an Android build and get it to run on the iPhone!

Twitter can be a funny beast, what makes it great can also make it poor. I use [Twhirl ](https://www.twhirl.org/)which keeps me updated any time one of the people I follow tweets about something, the only problem is that so many people tweet that if I dont happen to see it within about and hour or so of the Tweet, ill miss it. This time however I was lucky enough to catch a tweet by [@Joa](https://twitter.com/joa) about his new Inversion of Control and functional-programming-like library, [Funk AS3](https://code.google.com/p/funk-as3/).

            <description><![CDATA[
Thought I would share this little ditty. Been working in AIR recently and decided to make the window "chromeless" which means there are no controls so no resizing.

Thankfully however adobe provide the tools to allow for resizing the native window. So I produced this little mxml component to let you resize the window:

Thought id mention these videos as I have been watching them and really like the content. They are a series of video blog posts by one of the 'celebrities' of the Flash and Flex world, in which he talks about lots of stuff related to whats going on in the industry and the various frameworks he uses or recommends (or doesnt). He also has a few things to say about beer, which is a bonus!

Well after a little deliberation I decided to go for it and take a leap and pre-order a "[WakeMate](https://wakemate.com/)". Mainly as an experiment but partially to fuel the geeky gadget lover inside of me, but I do think this sort of thing is a natural extension to our techno-obsessed lifestyle.

Its [Oliver ](https://www.olip.co.uk/)and my latest game. It was supposed to be a quick re-skin of [BlastWave](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/flash/blast-wave/), but as usual "quick" was a word that got lost during development as we got excited about it and decided to add more and more features.

The Art by [Oliver Pitceathly](https://www.olip.co.uk/) follows a simmilar style to [MonkeyMines](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/personal-project/monkey-mines/). Hope you like it!

I know this is now a coupple of years old, but just [stumbled accross it.](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=31571)

I have always been into [the scene](https://www.scene.org) but from a distance, some of the stuff is ameturish, some is a programming marvel (the 4k,32k,64k comps) but this is just plain beautiful. Its a demo (all code) from ASD (look them up on youtube if you want more from them) called Lifeforce, enjoy!...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[
Been messing about with [Sound Cloud](https://soundcloud.com/mike-cann) recently, just seeing what all the audio related fuss is about and I must say its quite good. I have uploaded some of my mixes up there (not all of them as there is a size restriction on the number of uploads). I have also gone back and edited some of my old posts as the links to my old mixes no longer worked (thanks for [Richard Davey](https://www.photonstorm.com/) for spotting that one.

Im sure if you are technical individual you have come accross this god awful site countless times. Over and over again you type in a query your problem into google, something like "php upload The connection was reset" a perfectly legitimate question and one that probably has been answered on a forum before. You then go through the google results and more often than not you come accross something like this:

[FoodScanner ](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=331140646&mt=8)is an iPhone app that lets you scan a barcode and it then tells you about its nutritional info. Whats frustrating is that I had this idea over a year ago, the idea was that you scan an item, enter how much of it you ate, then the app keeps a running daily total of the amount of GDA of calories, fats, salts and more.

Ill be working with some of the people from GameJacket which is good as I know we work well together and I am familiar with the processes. I cant say exactly what I will be working on just that its flash based and ties in with what I have been doing in my previous roles at GameJacket and Dubit and in my own personal projects....]]></description>

Finally, finally I have decided to say sod it and stop tinkering with this god damn mix! I have been making and remaking this thing for the best part of a year but I can still see the rough edges. Its been driving me quite literally mad! Having said that however I have enjoyed making it, else I wouldn't do it... right?

As it has now [been posted](https://support.gamejacket.com/forums/19376/entries/40976) on the GameJacket Support site I guess its okay for me to announce too that GameJacket finished trading on the 8th while I was [away in Canada](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/?p=554).

Well we have already started development on what will be the next game. [Oliver](https://www.olip.co.uk) and I have decided to give one of my old titles [Blast Wave](https://www.artificialgames.co.uk/?p=96) a bit of a spruce up. We felt that the game had a good solid style with unique elements, the only thing that let it down was its poor graphics / user interface. So as this time around I have an excellent artist we think it can be given the breath of life it deserves.

We started by looking at various parts of the game and what we think let the game down...

**Go To Definition**
I love the Ctrl &amp; click feature in Eclipse/Netbeans and the Go To Definition feature in Visual Studio and have decided to implement them in [Flash develop](https://www.flashdevelop.org/community/index.php). After an evening or so of trying to write this myself I come accross the "ASComplete.DeclarationLookup()" method. To my great astonishment, this does exactly what I want. So thankyou to [Philippe](https://www.flashdevelop.org/community/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=3) or whoever wrote this method and did all the hardwork of the plugin for me ;)

Well here it is at last! Finally after almost a month of wheeling and dealing we have at last released Monkey Mines to the world at large.

What is it? Well its a remake of the classic Minesweeper game, but with a few changes. Rather than being top-down we have done it in an isometric fashion. Im not sure how successful this has been as some have reported that it makes the game harder to play being isometric.

            <description><![CDATA[
Well for the last few evenings I have been working on this little proof of concept. One of my work colleague Ade ([@6t8](https://twitter.com/6t8)) came up with the idea "someone should make a game that you can play over twitter". Well after abit of excitement and talk I decided to have a go at coding this idea. Once I had started I realised that it could be possible to do alot more with this, so I decided to make the project a little more generic and turn it into a pluggable bot for automating twitter.

            <description><![CDATA[
Well I spent hours at work today scratching my head and getting generally very annoyed over this one so I thought I would share it with the world so others can benefit from my frustrations.

            <description><![CDATA[
Well here is my next flash based offering...

Its called blast out and the idea is its a modern day version of Break Out. You have to bounce the ball around (which you may recognise from Blast Wave ;)) and destroy the terrain to release the particles. You can collect the particles by holding the left mouse to attract them down to your paddle.

            <description><![CDATA[
While i have been thinking about what im going to work on for my next flash game i have decided to look abit into whether doing destructible landscapes is now feasible with the new (ish) bitmap abilities.

Because of my earlier work on destructible landscapes on [LieroXNA ](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/?p=208)i know where the potential performance bottlenecks lie.

One of these is the reading of the pixel data to perform collision checks. This has to be quick as all the objects must check each frame to see if they collide with the terrain and potentially more than one "lookup" must happen to do this (pixel perfect collisions).

Well i have made a decision, instead of starting 10000 projects and never finishing i have decided instead to do some quick projects and shoot them out the door. So the best way to do this i figure is to make flash games.

So here is my first flash game of a few. Its basically a port of a game i did in the first year of uni in DarkBASIC but with some modifications.

Well i got asked a question [in a comment](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/?p=208#comment-1333) on how the terrains work in the LieroXNA project so I thought i would do a quick post on this rather than reply in the comments.

The way the terrains work has changed a few times over the course of development of the project for various reasons mostly related to the incompatabilities of the 360 and my previous methods. I wont go into those previous methods here but if anyone reading this has any questions dont hesitate to ask in a comment or email me. I would also like to say this may not be the most efficient method as I was only getting the terrains up as a proof of concept first then was planning on refining later.

            <description><![CDATA[
![](https://www.chillblast.com/images//d_5645.jpg)Well i bought my new shiny PC two weeks ago a nice quad core Q6000 machine with an nVidia 8800GTX. All was good and nice, progress on liero was flying along. The machine didnt even flinch at 1,000,000 particles, i conservatively estimate its capable of 5,000,000 at 30FPS. But just the other day it broke down, no reason, no warning, the mobo just went put. It turns on, the lights come on but it doesnt do anything, doesnt even get to the bios screen, nothing.<o:p></o:p>

            <description><![CDATA[
I have been working hard on LieroXNA this weekend and have managed to get quite abit of what I wanted done.

Firstly I worked on setting up a framework for weapons that allows them to be described by an external xml. This should reduce the effort involved in creating new weapons in the future. Taking a quick look at the XML that describes the rocket weapon you can see its straight forward but also pretty powerful:

            <description><![CDATA[
Well I took Liero into work today just to show to a few people who were interested and to test it on another machine other than my own. And low and behold it didnt work on my work machine which was no surprise as it doesnt have a graphics card so it fell down at the first hurdle. I then went to test it on an artists ATi based machine expecting it to work. It did but sadly there were no particles.

Okay I have decided to start a new mini pet project. As you may have guessed by now I have stopped work on the [TDProject](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/?p=170). The reason is that it is too large of a project to take on at the same time as having a job, should I ever find myself without a job in the future I may pick it up again.

It is basically a massive detox that should flush loads of stuff out of my system and set me on track for a healthier life.

[![](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/Work/TDProject/engine06.png)](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/Work/TDProject/engine06.png)

Got the next essential small step of the project in today, picking, that is selecting an object that exists within a 3D world from a mouse click in the 2D world. Found some really good resources for this including the [Hazy Mind](https://www.thehazymind.com/archives/2005/10/tutorial_9_picking_objects_fro.htm) site again and a new one I discovered by accident by [Charles Humphrey](https://randomchaosuk.blogspot.com/2007/05/engine-design-ray-picking.html). I had a little trouble at first with working out how to calculate a bounding box, but yet again the XNA community came to my rescue. Thanks to [Andy and his blog ](https://andyq.no-ip.com/blog/?p=16)I now have a custom content pipeline that generates a bounding box for my mesh automatically.

I have to be honest I haven't been working as hard as I could have recently on the TD project. The reason for this is that I have been trying to decide whether to progress with it atall. I believe it is an awesome project and will be successful, however each time I complete something in the project it adds to the complexity never subtracting from the amount of work remaining.

            <description><![CDATA[
![](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/Images/Others/particles17.png)This is another submission of work i have done in my final year. This time the project is all my own work.

The project is a continuation based on [work from before Christmas](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/?p=148) and is an experiment into state preserving particle systems. I started out with examining the basic particle systems such as a static system and one that updates on the CPU. I then moved onto more advanced systems such as the GPU based system described by [Lance Latta](https://www.2ld.de/gdc2004/) and others. I soon discovered however that XNA doesn't support "uber buffers" and as such had to invent a new solution using vertex textures. The result is a particle system written in XNA that is able to update and render 1,000,000 particles at about 22 frames a second with 4 forces.

Okay this is a very very alpha release of a game that was created for a team project at the final year of university.

The game is a 2D version of Valves up and coming game [Portal.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if3Qv2tHyfA) You are a scientist in a lab experimentig with the new handhelf portal device that allows you to create portals anywhere that allow you to pass through to the other side. The goal of the game is to solve puzzles and get to the exit in the fastest time possible.

![](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Image/RM02.png)This is my second dabble in HLSL and this time it was just for personal reasons. I wanted to create a shadow effect for a 2D game that we are developing for our group project. Its actually very hard to find any resources on the internet about this but i did stumble accross one resource (which i have now lost the link to) where someone has created a basic shadow effect purely in shaders.

This is an old piece of flash from an age ago. Its kinda a 2-parter, the first part is a sig i made for the forums over at my [clans website](https://www.clan1.co.uk). The second part is a tutorial i did shortly after making the sig. I got a couple of requests of how i made such a thing so i decided to write a very basic flash tutorial. Remember this is quite old so the flash version is a little out of date.

Ronnie O'Sulivans Snooker is a game that i worked on at rockpool games. It was infact one of my very first games at [Rockpool ](https://www.rockpoolgames.co.uk)and subsequently one of my very first Java games. I started off only doing the menu system for the game, but in the end i worked on virtually every part of the game including the 3D graphics engine which was written from scratch with no built in 3D API's to assist with rendering.

            <title><![CDATA[Flash Whiteboard]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[
The flash whiteboard is a little experiment i cooked up in a couple of days. It basically allows the user to 'hand write' a message which is then saved on the server. Once done you can then [view the list of messages](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/?page_id=131). The whiteboard was written in flash and php was used to communicate with the server.

![](/wp-content/uploads/Image/Cannyshammy.jpg)This little flash movie was created for my old everquest guild when i left the game. Its more of a montage of my time in everquest and is presented as a kinda slideshow. I played the game for 3 years and i still have many fond memories of my time in the game.

**Artist:** [Artificial](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/www.artificial-studios.co.uk) ** Genre:** downtempo / chillout / pop

Well its a long time in the coming but here it is, the second part of my Harmonics series. I started this thing about four months ago and only now have i found the time to complete it. Its a little shorter than the previous version mainly because i ran out of tracks that fit the flow of the set. Im extremely happy with the first half but the second half, im not entirely sure, give it a listen and leave me a comment of what u think :)...]]></description>

Well here is some flash i did a couple of months back now. I had planned to do a whole series of these and upload the source for others to use on their site, but other projects came up that required my attention more. Perhaps I will get time to do them this summer :)

            <description><![CDATA[
This was a tech demo I created for one of my final projects in my second year of university. Due to the severe time restrictions at the end of the term i wasnt able to do the project i wanted to (ToyTown MMORPG) so insted of trying to struggle and force a large project into a small time frame i decided not to do a MMORPG.

This is my first ever project i did in DirectX. It was created again for a university project at the start of the year in 2004\. I had ambitious plans for a dynamic mesh manipulation application so the user could create their own personal avatar for a MMORPG.

            <description><![CDATA[
