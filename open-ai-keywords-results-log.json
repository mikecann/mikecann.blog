I wanted to see how optimized i could create the system to get as many particles as possible on the screen at one time. As you can see, its starts slowing down quite easily (around 500 on a normal system). Apparently with AS3 we will get ints as a data type which will hopefully will speed things up a bit :)\nOnce i get a chance ill upload the source for this, but for now here is the .swf\n\nKeywords: ",

    "title": "A lil AS3 Performance Testing",
    "prompt": "Blog Post: While i have been thinking about what im going to work on for my next flash game i have decided to look abit into whether doing destructible landscapes is now feasible with the new (ish) bitmap abilities.\nBecause of my earlier work on destructible landscapes on LieroXNA i know where the potential performance bottlenecks lie.\nOne of these is the reading of the pixel data to perform collision checks. This has to be quick as all the objects must check each frame to see if they collide with the terrain and potentially more than one \"lookup\" must happen to do this (pixel perfect collisions).\n\nSo before i dive into this potentially hazardous project i have decided to do a little performance checking to see which method would be the best.\nMy reasoning is i can either:\nA - check the pixel data of a BitmapData object using getPixel or getPixel32\nB - store the collision data in an Array which may allow for faster reading.\nC - instead of using an array use a ByteArray which may be even quicker\nSo to test which of these methods is quicker i wrote this quick thing in FlashDevelop:\npublic class Main extends Sprite\n\n             {\n\n              public function Main():void\n\n              {\n\n\n\n               // Vars\n\n               var i : int;\n\n               var j : int;\n\n               var x : int;\n\n               var y : int;\n\n               var w : int = 500;\n\n               var h : int = 500;\n\n               var reps : int = 50;\n\n               var n : int = w * h;\n\n               var tmp : int;\n\n               var tmp2 : uint;\n\n               var t : cTimer = new cTimer();\n\n               var ba : ByteArray = new ByteArray();\n\n               var a : Array = new Array();\n\n               var bm : BitmapData = new BitmapData(w, h, false);\n\n               var tbm : BitmapData = new BitmapData(w, h, true);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               trace(\"\");\n\n               trace(\"\");\n\n               \n\nKeywords: ",

    "prompt": "Blog Post: Well I spent hours at work today scratching my head and getting generally very annoyed over this one so I thought I would share it with the world so others can benefit from my frustrations.\nBasically I wanted a method of loading a SWF as a byte array then turning the byte array back into a SWF at run-time. This is quite handily catered for in AS3 with the use of URLStream and Loader.loadBytes().\n\nSo my flow looked like:\n**SWFA -> StreamURL.load(\"SWFB.swf\")\nSWFA -> Loader.loadBytes() **\nSo off I went and coded my solution, to my surprise it worked great. Well kinda, the problem with using loadBytes() is that you have no way of passing flashVars through to the loaded SWF like normal (see this bug report for more info: https://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FP-445).\nWhen you inspect the root.loaderInfo.url (_root._url in as2) property of the loaded swf it gives you the URL of the loader instead of the URL you want. My solution to this was to proxy the loading in another swf and then pass this swf all the params I want to go in the child swf.\nSo the flow looks like:\n**SWFA -> Loader.load(\"proxy.swf?someparam=22\")\nProxySWF -> StreamURL.load(\"SWFB.swf\")\nProxySWF -> Loader.loadBytes() **\nThis way when you call root.loaderInfo.url from within SWFB it will give you something like: \"https://www.mydomain.com/proxy.swf?someparam=22\" which isnt perfect but atleast you have the params there to play with.\nUnfortunately however when I implemented this nothing happened. The proxy loaded, it loaded SWFB fine, added it to the stage but nothing was displayed. No errors nothing. I found this very perplexing as the code was practically the same as before just in a different SWF.\nAnyways, to cut a long story short I finally found out what was going wrong. The document class of the proxy was named \"Main.as\" and the document class of SWFB is was named \"Main.as\". I renamed one of them and suddenly\n\nKeywords: ",

But this upgrade now means I can upload videos to picassa, yey!\nGo check out the photos on my picassa account HERE.

We spent NYE in a club called Matrix with some of her friends. As you can see from some of the pictures i have taken they do things a little differently in Germany for NYE (donuts at midnight ?!).\n\nAnyways, I totally enjoyed myself and would love to go back again but now its back to GameJacket and my other Games. On that subject I have been resting over Christmas after the stress of releasing Flashteroids, and have had time to think about what my next game will be. My question is has anyone seen a good remake of Minesweeper in Flash?\nSome highlights from Berlin\n\nKeywords: ",

I originally intended to allow users to make thier own levels in-game which they could then share with others.

They even have a \"golf course\":\n\nFollowing on from Coober Pedy we headed south past the incredible fields of yellow canola\n\nUntil we reached the coastline and the small town of Fowlers Bay.\n\nWe werent expecting much from Fowlers Bay but ended up having an awesome time there.\nIts a surprisingly beautiful place with stunning sand dunes and groups of whales just off the shore.\n\n\nEvening were spent huddled around the campfire with the other guests drinking beer and sharing stories. Exactly what you want from a camping trip.\n\nUnfortunately we had to move on after a few days and make our way to Esperance, first stopping off at the incredible Bunda Cliffs on the Nulabore Highway.\n\nThen finally we arrived at the drone mecca that is Esperance. Why do I call it drone mecca, well just take a look at these:\n\n\n\n\nIts hard not be be impressed by the raw beauty of this place and in my opinion its best viewed from above.\n\n\n\nA few days in Esperance and it was sadly all over for our epic 5-month trip.\nIts been an incredible experience of highs and lows and I hope that you have enjoyed following along.\nOnto the next adventure!\n\nKeywords: ",

Firstly the main tool:\n\nThe tool lets an artist or designer visually lay out their effect in an easy to use and understand manner. Once an effect has been created it can be exported out to either the XNA SDK or the Flash SDK for a programmer to use in thier own projects:\n\nI have produced video tutorials explaining how to use these in conjunction with each other. However you must understand this is mainly an academic project and I had realy intended to clean this up before I released it.\nThere is also a GIF animation export option that I added late in the project and as such is a little slow and buggy :P\n\nThe source code is included within the project.

Unfortunately they paid at least \\$300 for thiers, and hence this wasnt realy an option for me just yet :P\nSo for now im stuck with an old 2005 style UI. To spice it up abit I decided to add docking panels. I had worked with docking panels before for my ChainReaction project in Java but hadnt done one in C# before. A quick search on sourceforge came up with DockPanel Suite.\nIt certainly wasn't as easy to pick up as when I did docking panels in Java, but I eventually got it. The toughest part which I still haven't sorted out 100% is rendering a XNA window into a docking panel. As XNA runs using a DirectX graphics device its very picky about loosing its rendering state. So if a user undocks the window and moves it about and then redocks it, it doesnt like it due to the loss of rendering state. For now the XNA window has been fixed so that it cant be undocked.\nAs you can see in the screenshot above I have added some visual properties to the BlueprintEditor so that you can affect how its rendered, its all working beautifully.\nThe next step is to get the blueprints being placed on the grid so that you can build the level.\n\nKeywords: ",

    "prompt": "Blog Post: While working on Mr Nibbles Forever I have encountered many annoying errors with Unity. None has been more annoying than the dreaded AOT errors I was getting when building for iOS.\n\nI foolishly had gone a while (a few weeks) without attempting to build for iOS. In that time I had added many third party libraries and made changes to much of the code. I decided one day to do a build for my iPad. I fired up Unity on OSX and tried to build and ran into the following:\n\n  stderr:\n  at UnityEditor.MonoProcessUtility.RunMonoProcess (System.Diagnostics.Process process, System.String name, System.String resultingFile) [0x00000] in :0\n  at UnityEditor.MonoCrossCompile.CrossCompileAOT (BuildTarget target, System.String crossCompilerAbsolutePath, System.String assembliesAbsoluteDirectory, CrossCompileOptions crossCompileOptions, System.String input, System.String output, System.String additionalOptions) [0x00000] in :0\n  at UnityEditor.MonoCrossCompile+JobCompileAOT.ThreadPoolCallback (System.Object threadContext) [0x00000] in :0\n  UnityEditor.HostView:OnGUI()\n\nAh jeeze, I thought to myself, I have no idea what could be causing this compile error. Unity gives me no information where or why this error is occurring. I have no idea what these third party libraries are doing behind the scenes. Perhaps one of them is interfering with one of the others? They all work fine on my windows / android build. sigh\nSo I ripped out all the third party libraries and tried to build again and surprise surprise the error was still there. So now I was really confused. What was going on, was it something in one my scenes?\nSo I created a blank scene and set that as the only scene the in game, built again and the error was still there. Now I was really worried, I had made a bunch of changes since the last build, which of those was it? I had no idea and I really didnt want to go line by line and comment \n\nKeywords: ",

    "title": "Fixing Unity's Internal Compiler Error",
    "prompt": "Blog Post: As mentioned in my last post, I am working on a Unity game that takes advantage of Parse for Asyncronous multiplayer. Well one nice feature of parse is that it uses Tasks to handle its asynchronicity.\n\nTasks are very much like JS promises (except they are type-safe) and return when the operation has completed. For example:\n[code lang=\"csharp\"]\nobj.SaveAsync().ContinueWith(task =>\n{\nif (task.IsCanceled)\n{\n// the save was cancelled.\n}\nelse if (task.IsFaulted)\n{\nAggregateException exception = task.Exception;\n}\nelse\n{\n// the object was saved successfully.\n}\n});\n[/code]\nYou can chain tasks together like so:\n[code lang=\"csharp\"]\nvar query = new ParseQuery(\"Student\")\n.OrderByDescending(\"gpa\");\nquery.FindAsync().ContinueWith(t =>\n{\nvar students = t.Result;\nIEnumerator enumerator = students.GetEnumerator();\nenumerator.MoveNext();\nvar student = enumerator.Current;\nstudent[\"valedictorian\"] = true;\nreturn student.SaveAsync();\n}).Unwrap().ContinueWith(t =>\n{\nreturn query.FindAsync();\n}).Unwrap().ContinueWith(t =>\n{\nvar students = t.Result;\nIEnumerator enumerator = students.GetEnumerator();\nenumerator.MoveNext();\nenumerator.MoveNext();\nvar student = enumerator.Current;\nstudent[\"salutatorian\"] = true;\nreturn student.SaveAsync();\n}).Unwrap().ContinueWith(t =>\n{\n// Everything is done!\n});\n[/code]\nThe problem is that if you want to catch errors you must manually check the task return for errors inside each handler. This seemed wasteful to me as all I wanted was a global error handler for that particular task chain, such as can be achieved with Javascript Promises.\nFortunately someone else also had noticed this problem and solved it:\n[code lang=\"csharp\"]\nTask.Factory.StartNew(StartBusyIndicator)\n.Then(task => GetWebResponseAsync(url))\n.Then(task => Console.WriteLine(task.Result.Headers))\n.Finally(ExceptionHandler, StopBusyIndicator);\n[/code]\nThe only problem is that when I tried to impl\n\nKeywords: ",

To do this lets add a new class to the project and call it GJCheck.as:\n\nNow we are going to fill this with the same code as there is in the \"main.as\" of the AS3 folder of the GameJacket Developer Pack:\npackage\n{\nimport flash.display.Sprite;\nimport flash.display.LoaderInfo;\nimport flash.events.Event;\nimport flash.text.TextField;\nimport flash.text.TextFieldAutoSize;\npublic class GJCheck extends Sprite\n{\npub\n\nKeywords: ",

I have been so super busy of late on a project that I havent really had any time for technical personal projects.\n\nI have however had time to do a little home-brewing so I thought I would share a little tip I had picked up. A little white back a friend lent me his kit for homebrewing. Its so simple all you have to do is fill a two litre bottle with juice and sugar, add a little yeast and cap it off with a simple valve-cap. Leave it for a few weeks and you have a 'tastey' strong beverage.\nThe problem however is knowing how long to leave it. The instructions say 2-3weeks but that is heavily dependant on a number of factors such as the ambient temperature of the room. At first what I was doing was putting the juice, yeast and sugar in at the same time then giving it a good shake so all the sugar was disolved.\nI have discovered a better way of doing things however. If you put the sugar in the bottom then put the yeast on top then gently pour in the juice over it then you get a rough indicator of when the fermentation process has completed. As the yeast grows and respirates it burns its way down through the sugar slowly converting the sucrose to alcohol. What this results in is a slowly shifting yeast layer as it works it way down. When the layer hits the bottom, no more sugar left and the brew is ready for drinking :)\n\nKeywords: ",

For those not aware of Terraria, it looks something like this:\n\nTo produce the above you need several layers of tilemaps (background, water, foreground etc) that can potentially change every single frame (due to lighting environment effects etc). To do that at 1680x1050 at 16x16 per tile with only one layer changing each frame will be 6800 tile draws per frame.\nHaving calculated that I got thinking about the best way to render lots of tiles.\nMy first thought was to render each tile as a separate quad. That would certainty work, however it would mean that for each tile I would need 4 vertices, times that by say 4 layers that's 108,800 vertices. Its not a massive massive amount but sizable enough for me to wonder if there was a more efficient way.\nMy next thought was that I could share vertices by using vertex indices in a triangle-strip, that way at best each tile will only require just over one vertex per tile then arrange them in a lattice so that the vertices are shard between tiles:\n\nThis would then only require about 27,200 vertices which is really nice. I was hover having difficulties imagining how I would reference each tile individually in the shader so I could apply texture and color transformations and started wondering if another technique might work..\nHaving recently done some work with Point Sprite Particles I knew that the GPU was really good at rendering Point Sprites. So I thought to myself, why not just make each tile a point sprite. That way I could then represent each tile as a vertex then I could pass custom properties such as texture and color to the sh\n\nKeywords: ",

I realised that instead of just passing in the terrain texture to the particle update routine i could pass the entire back buffer allowing the player and any other objects in the scene to have particle reactions, yey!\nParticles now have a bit of alpha blending to make them look a little less in focus, not sure if this works well, let me know :)\n\nKeywords: ",

Flash Builder is the main professional coding environment for Actionscript and MXML and is sold by Adobe.\n\nIts fairly okay as an IDE, not the best but not the worst also. I wont go into all of Flash Builders' problems (I would be here forever) but instead want to talk about one key way you can improve your efficiency when working in Flash Builder.\nFirstly the test environment :\n\nIts a pretty beasty machine, the project and flash builder folders are sat on an SSD drive.\nI have two projects to test these compile times with. Using RichCodeAnalyser:\nProject A\n\n1670 Classes, 188,771 Lines\nProject B\n\n2386 Classes, 135,647 Lines\nBoth projects have a mixture of MXML and AS files as well as employing several .swc libraries.\nIll be testing two different scenarios. 1 complete build from clean. 2. a single line change in the Main class. Ill run each test three times and take the average. I close FB down between projects just in-case there is any memory caching limiting the performance. All builds are built in debug mode using various different Flex SDK versions.\nSo using the vanilla install of Flash Builder 4.6:\n\nNot a good start. The two projects wont even compile. They get so far through the build then crash, not just the compiler but the entire IDE itself, ugh!\nSo the first improvement is to up the amount of memory that Flash Builder has. Incredibly  (in this day and age) you have to manually do this, it isn't built into Flash Builder (which is built on Eclipse). So to do this you need to edit the FlashBuilder.ini found (on my machine) at:\nC:Program Files (x86)AdobeAdobe Flash Builder 4.6FlashBuilder.ini\n\nThe main setting for the amount of memory is \"-Xmx512m\" which sets the maximum value of the heap to 512Mb. So to give FB more memory set that to:\n-Xmx1024m\n\nIf you try to set it any\n\nKeywords: ",

    "prompt": "Blog Post: I have decided that I would like to learn more about mobile game development. Its an exciting area of the games industry at the moment with so many frameworks and languages to choose from to develop with. The plethora of choice however can be a hindrance, what are the best frameworks and language for this particular task? Haxe with NME?  C# MonoTouch with Monogame? or even Javascript with Titanium? One can only go so far just reading about them, eventually you have to jump in and try them out for yourself.\n\nSo on that note I have decided to team up with an artist colleague (Moh 'Mohzart' Mukhtar) from work to create a mobile game in three weeks of evenings and weekends. Three weeks is an ambitious target for a game on any platform let alone mobile with its added complications. The primary purpose of this project however is to gather experience on the process of making mobile games using a given langauge, framework and platform. Having a longer time-scale I feel would deter from this, the primary motivation. Having said that however, I hope that in three weeks we will have something that to be reasonably proud of.\nFor this particular game I have decided to explore Haxe with NME. Haxe is a programming language I have been using for my personal projects for about a year now and is ideally suited to mobile development due to its ability to target multiple platforms with the same codebase. NME is a framework written in Haxe that emulates the Flash API and thus provides an interface I am extremely familiar with having used it for many years on personal and professional games. I dabbled with NME about a year ago while at the TryHarder conference however things have moved on with the project a lot since then and im looking forward to getting stuck in and playing around with it some more.\nIn theory Haxe with NME should give us the ability to target Flash, HTML5, OSX, Linux, Wi\n\nKeywords: ",

And low and behold it didnt work on my work machine which was no surprise as it doesnt have a graphics card so it fell down at the first hurdle. I then went to test it on an artists ATi based machine expecting it to work. It did but sadly there were no particles.\n\nWell after digging around abit, I discovered that it was the same problem I encountered before when I released my 1,000,000 particles demo a few months ago. The problem is that ATi dont include the ability to use Vertex Textures in their graphics hardware (the core technology allowing me to get many particles on the screen). I knew the solution from previous work was to use ATi's alternative Renter To Vertex Buffer (R2VB) unfortunately I could not find anyone else that had done this in XNA before which led me to the suspicion that it wasnt possible. I posted on the XNA forum about this, you can see the replies here.\nAnyways to cut a long story short I have not been able to implement R2VB for ATi cards but I have instead done the next best thing which is to implement a CPU particle system instead. This means that people with realy old cards (or like my work machine without a card atall) or people with ATi cards they can still play the game and still have particles, just not as many (200-400k on nVidia, 10-50k on CPU).\nAlso something I implemented over the weekend was this fancy console which, makes life alot easier for me when developing, isnt it nice ;)\n\nKeywords: ",

The reason is that it is too large of a project to take on at the same time as having a job, should I ever find myself without a job in the future I may pick it up again.\n\nSo the new project is designed to be alot smaller than the last and should give a more immediate sense of achievement. The project is going to be a clone of the popular game Liero but for XNA (so xbox eventualy). For those that havent played it, its a real-time 2D action game (basically worms without the turn based tedium).\nSo far im just playing around with getting the core of the engine up and running. The original Liero and its successive clones were all done in C/C++. In those languages you have the ability to pixel blit, that is write directly to the back buffer one pixel at a time. In XNA/C# however you dont have that ability, so you have to do some funky stuff with shaders. The advantage of doing it this way however is that GPU particles that have physics (can bounce around the level) should fall out of the code nicely allowing for large numbers of particles.\nAnyways, as I said its just a beginning for now. So far I have a level rendered with a terrain map, an explosion map (renders explosions to the texture each frame if any occurred) and a collision map which allows objects to collide. With the left mouse button you can blow holes in the terrain which in turn updates the collision map allowing the worm to move around more of the level.\n\nKeywords: ",

This should reduce the effort involved in creating new weapons in the future. Taking a quick look at the XML that describes the rocket weapon you can see its straight forward but also pretty powerful:\n\n\n\n \n  rocket\n  smoke\n \n\n  \n   \n   \n   \n  \n \n\nIn addition I have been working on adding forces into the game. It took abit of tweaking but now explosions have a force which repels particles around it, you can see this in action in the video below. I have also added a \"vortex\" special weapon that sucks particles towards it which then swirl around until the vortex implodes expelling all the particles.\nThe size of the world has now been expanded and a simple camera has been added. Previously the intention was the world was to be split into multiple tiles of 1024x768 textures but i have now decided against that due to the level of complexity involved and gone for a system that uses one large texture (2048x2048 currently) instead. I have also changed the texture so its a little less \"programmer art\" as I was getting some stick for that :P\nThere is still alot of work to be done but im happy with the way it looks at the moment. You will have to excuse the video quality below, flash isnt the best compression for alot of fast moving small particles.\nIf you want to see a larger less compressed video (35meg) you can download it HERE.\n\nKeywords: ",

    "prompt": "Blog Post: As this is a level based puzzle game one of the big requirements for the project will be the ability to quickly build and test levels. In the original Mr Nibbles the levels were all 2D generated from a bitmap image where each pixel represents a single tile in the world. So for example here is level 4:\n\n\nRepresenting the levels as a bitmap image meant that Photoshop became my level editor which allowed me to very quickly make changes and test the levels as I made them.\nObviously that scheme wont work for 3D so I started thinking about how to build levels in the editor. If you have used Unity before you will know that in addition to the actual editor they run a website called the Asset Store where users can submit tools and assets that others can use in their project. It was on there that I came across the Tidy Tile Mapper:\n\nIt looked exactly what I wanted. So I bought it and started using it to build the first few levels you see in the video at the start of this post. It was while I was using it that I discovered problems in the way it works.\nFirstly its slow to use both from a performance perspective and from a usability perspective. There aren't any hot keys for commonly used things and painting and removing blocks just chugs after a while. I also don't like the way the tool handles \"empty\" blocks which are infact real object that clutter up the hierarchy. The block editor also doesn't seem to handle some rotations. The way it handles layers is awkward and will be a pain for this game that will require many layers or axis' of movement.\nIn short I decided I could do better:\n\nIts only a few hours work at this point and doesn't have all the features of the Tidy Tile Mapper but it has enough for me to get building my levels quickly. It works by having a \"working axis\" that you can paint blocks to or remove blocks from. All blocks are added as a child of a \"blockmap\" whic\n\nKeywords: ",

It would be possible to construct levels such that they can't be rotate into a position that anything would be obscured but it would severely restrict the number and type of levels I could build.\n\n\nThe solution to this problem was to shoot a ray (well, several rays) from the player to the camera, if they collide with anything then its obscuring and thus I fade it out. When its no longer obscuring I fade it back in again. It works pretty well as a solution though I will need to see how it actually works out when I build more levels.\nI have also been thinking about the menus in the game. I was wonder if there was a way to make the menus more interesting. Then I had the idea, why not make the menus a level? That way I could introduce the basic controls at the same time!\n\nEach section of the menus are navigable by jumping into the portal which loads the next menu section. Obviously this wont work for menus that need sliders and checkboxes like the options screen, in those cases ill just pop up a regular menu. What do you think? Is it a good idea or will it get annoying?\n\nKeywords: ",

Its starting to take shape a little more now which i'm happy about.\n\nI had a few people play the first Prototype last week and the overwhelming response was that it was too hard so the first thing I did this week was to make the game easier. So I slowed Mr Nibbles down and making the tilting of the device more responsive. Then I added a difficulty progression to the game. The longer you play it the harder the game gets. Check out the difficulty progression in the video below:\n\nI achieved the difficulty change by ranking each chunk by difficulty then selecting an appropriate one randomly as the player moves along.\n\nAs can be seen in the video there are now 3 themes that the player progresses through as they go along. This mirrors the 3 stages that can be found in the original game:\n\nI worried about this for a little while as I wasnt sure how to get the three themes in the game and make it work. The solution was to have transitions between the themes and have each theme more difficult from the last so that as you play from the cage to the backyard to orbit the game progresses smoothly in difficulty.\nBecause the game now features three distinct themes I needed to upgrade my chunk building tools to accommodate the different tiling requirements for each theme:\n\nBuilding tilesets is now a breeze thanks to custom inspectors and other editor tools.\n\nI have a long list of features building up on Trello:\n\nBut this week I hope to have most of the chunks complete and have started or finished work on the meta-game. What is the meta-game? Well find out next week ;)\nBTW, if you are interested in testing the game on iOS send me an email: mike.cann@gmail.com and ill get you added as a beta tester.

After that ill scoot across to Chicago where ill meet up with another friend and explore the city.\nAfter a few days in Chicago ill fly south to North Carolina where ill spend a nice week with some other friends. From there ill fly to L.A. where I have a 45 day Trek America trek booked. A group of 15 of us will be travelling on buses or local transport down into central america on what looks to be an incredible journey.\nThe trek finishes on the 17th of July which I then have a few days of respite in San Jose Costa Rica before I make my way down and across to Panama City. From there I have a flight to Bogata Colombia. There im meeting a friend and we are going to journey together north to the coast of Colombia.\nAfter that things start to get a little hazy.

Im moving away from the £35 per month hosting of 1&1 because although I like the freedom of having my own box that I can remote into i’m just finding it too expensive for me to justify having it. There are so many Platform as a Service (PaaS) options out there that provide high quality hosting cheaply I thought I would switch over.\nLast year Google announced that you can now host WordPress blogs on Google App Engine so I decided to take the plunge and set it up. It turns out that its not actually that hard. The hard part came with the fact that this blog is 10 years old now and contains 426 posts. That means a huge database that is not easy to import into a new provider. Fortunately this post came to my rescue, in the end it only cost me \\$0.88 in instance backend time to import the whole thing.\nSo now I have my blog hosted on Google App Engine, I moved all my content over to Google Cloud Storage too so its all hosted on Google’s Edge CDN network for super fast access, nice! I am currently running in the free tier for everything except for the Cloud SQL server which WordPress unfortunately needs so that means i’m paying \\$11 per month for that. Not bad considering that it used to cost me on 1&1 and I get all the nice Google features such as backups, redundancy and infinite scaling.\nAt the same time I thought I would tart the site up a little and bought a new theme. This time I went for a theme called Feather from Suitstheme which I rather like! Let me know what you think in the comments.\n\nKeywords: ",

    "title": "New Indie Game: Mr Nibbles 3D",
    "prompt": "Blog Post: In-between the downtime of the main game (yet to be announced) I decided to experiment around with an idea I had a while ago.\n\nA couple of years ago I released a totally free game Mr Nibbles, a project I worked on with a colleague from Playdemic. As part of my employment contract at Playdemic I was unable to make any money from games produced in my spare time so I decided to run the project as a challenge to myself; could I make a cross-platform mobile game in 3 weeks of evenings and weekends? Well it actually took 5 weeks but I was pretty happy with the result. Currently it has 25k downloads on android:\n\nAnd 23k on iOS\n\nNot bad considering we did no marketing whatsoever.\nSo I decided why not use some of the skills I have developed with Unity and have a go at making a 3D version? It turns out it was a lot easier to prototype that I thought. The above video is the result after just a few short hours.\nI took the original 4 levels and wrote a converter that reproduced each tile in the original 2D level as a cube in the new 3D level. It was very simple but it got me thinking, why restrict it to the one rotation axis like in the 2D version? What if Mr Nibbles could move into out of the world too? A few hours later and I had quickly prototyped the many-axis concept:\n\nThis definitely has potential. Stay tuned for further posts on the development of the side-project.\n\nKeywords: ",

But now all i have left is one exam I have been seeking a new project that I can undertake.\n\nI was looking for a specific kind of project. It had to be something that I am passionate about (i work so much better when i enjoy the project). It preferably had to have something to do with tools and it had to have enough new things in it that I had never done before so that I could learn new stuff.\nWith that said it took alot of head scratching and many weeks passed. I watched many videos of up and coming games and watched several videos related to new PS3 games and in particular \"little big planet\". This is exactly the type of project I wanted to work on, its a tool but its a game at the same time. If you havent seen it then you can check it here. Basically all the content in the world is created in an interactive fun tool by the community which then gets uploaded and others can play.\nI asked myself how can I take the idea of little big planet and game 3.0 and apply it to a project I want to do? Well it dawned on me while i was playing a Tower Defence (TD) on Warcraft 3, I can make this!\nFor those of you that dont know, TD's are mini games that happened by accident. When Blizzard released Warcraft 3 they also released their powerful map editor with it, soon the community were making their own maps and campaigns. Soon people started to notice other features of the map editor like the ability to link triggers together. Duke Wintermaull invented the first TD (i think), basically you and 7 other people have to stop waves of monsters that spawn at the top of the map from getting to the bottom of the map by placing defencive fortifications along the way. As you kill more monsters you get more gold so you can build more defences, simple conce\n\nKeywords: ",

I was so amazed at some of the beautiful patterns and effects that the particles were making I thought it may be nice rather than just releasing a tech demo, to add abit more to it and release it for others to enjoy.\nI will be releasing the source code in the coming weeks along with a blog post which should explain in detail how the technical aspects of updating and rendering tens of thousands of particles per frame works.\nThe tool features a gallery tab which you can use to take screenshots then upload them to my picassa account (proxyed via php). The hope is to get some realy beautiful images in here, perhaps if some are good enough ill get them printed and framed ;)\nI hope to come back to this project regularly to add new features so stay tuned.

PlaceEd is a small app used by people at work who need to design levels with objects and paths in them.\n\nThe reason for making this new version was because the original was starting to show its age and after several modifications to customise it to certain projects it has become unreliable. A second version (PlaceEd2) was half coded by one of the other employees at rockpool though they ran out of time and didn’t complete it.\nSo that’s where I come in, and I wrote from scratch a new app and called it PlaceEd 3 (even though there wasn’t really a fully released version of PlaceEd 2).\n\n\nPlaceEd3 lets the user create a new project. This project can have levels added to it. Each level can have a certain number of layers. Layers can be either one large image or a tileset and tileset data. The user can then create objects and give them variables that can either be static (global to all objects of that type) or they can be local which means each object has its own value for that variable. Objects can then be placed on the level and moved and dragged about. Paths can also be placed on the level, this is useful for games that need to script specific movement sequences.\nOnce a level has been designed it can then be exported as a single binary file that is easily compressed and a java source file that gives a demonstration of how to load the binary data file.\nThe whole app is written in C# using WeifenLuo docking panels. For the rendering of the level I have integrated an XNA 2.0 panel for speed it gives.\n\nKeywords: ",

The goal of the game is to solve puzzles and get to the exit in the fastest time possible.\n\nAs i said the game is very very alpha and as such has many holes. The reason i am releasing this now as i dont think im going to have time to work on it in the near future so best get this out now.\nI personally worked on the engine of the game, the menus were done by another team member. The engine features full bloom lighting effect to make all those shineys abit more umm shiney :D\nAnyways, to play this game you will need the XNA runtimes, use THIS to get them installed.\nOnce that is done you can go ahead and dowload the game HERE.\nEnjoy!\n\nKeywords: ",

Some wanted me to fix things some wanted me to add things others wanted to buy the extension outright.\n\nWell I didn't have time to do any of those things while I was away so put it off until I returned home. Well I have been back now for a few weeks and have decided to spend quite a bit of time upgrading the extension.\nUnfortunately my time isnt free now that I am working freelance and so I need to justify the time spent working on the extension. So I need a way to monetize the app. There are quite a few ways to do it and I couldn't decide which to go for so I surveyed my users.\n\nThe results were interesting:\n\nIf you take the results on face value it looks as if people didnt mind ad injection but I suspect that they misunderstood the meaning of what ad injection was and thought I just meant adverts. I decided that ad injection was a little too evil for me and decided to go with making the donation more prominent.\nTo do this I rewrote the entire app using Typescript with KnockoutJS and then make the donations front and center. When a user opens the window they are presented with a popup that informs them about all the new features and improvements and gives them an opportunity to donate:\n\nFrom there they are taken to the donate tab of the options that lets them quickly and easily donate.\n\nI decided to set the minimum donation amount to \\$3 which is about the price of a cup of tea in Starbucks.\nAs an incentive I have locked certain features such as the advanced 1-click process and a suggestion submission feature:\n\nI also have promised new features coming soon which donors will have access to:\n\nOn the whole people have responded well to the changes however there have unfortunately been some negative reviews from people on the chrome web store.\nThe negative r\n\nKeywords: ",

    "prompt": "Blog Post: Well since we have made the decision to discontinue Printomi I have been backing up the databases and downloading the 90GB+ of images that users have uploaded.\nWell it wouldn't be like me if I didn't start thinking about what cool things I do with all those pixels. I remember seeing those cool Mincraft maps that use the Google Maps API to explore the Minecraft servers and it got me thinking if it could be possible to do something like that but for the Printomi images.\n\nWell it turns out yes, you can: https://storage.googleapis.com/printomimaps/index.html\nIts only 1,024 of the total 27,497 images that were uploaded but even this small ratio results in a total map size of 115,200 x 86,400 pixels. The Google Maps obviously cant handle an image that large and it would take forever to download so you must split it up into many tiles. To achieve the zooming and performance you must also provide the map at various sizes.\nWith a map of 32x32 image with each image at 3600x2700 pixels and each tile at 450x337 this results in 87,000 tiles at 8 zoom levels! Generating and uploading all that data takes several days. But the result is you can pan and zoom around what seems like one huge 115k x 84k image.\nIf you are interested I have uploaded the source code I wrote to generate the 349k tiles at the various zoom levels from the 1024 3600x2700 input images. You can find it over on Github: https://github.com/mikecann/PrintomiMaps\nIf I had enough disk space on my web server I would love to do the whole 37,000 images in this way. If I did 128x128 that would use 16,384 of the images. This would result in 10 zoom levels and a map 460,800 x 345,600 pixels large. I have no idea or how long it would take to generate and upload all those tiles :P\n\nKeywords: ",

    "prompt": "Blog Post: Well i got asked a question in a comment on how the terrains work in the LieroXNA project so I thought i would do a quick post on this rather than reply in the comments.\nThe way the terrains work has changed a few times over the course of development of the project for various reasons mostly related to the incompatabilities of the 360 and my previous methods. I wont go into those previous methods here but if anyone reading this has any questions dont hesitate to ask in a comment or email me. I would also like to say this may not be the most efficient method as I was only getting the terrains up as a proof of concept first then was planning on refining later.\n\nBefore i can explain how the terrain is deformed i must first talk about how the terrain is composed. There are currently three layers to the level, an indestuctable layer, a destructable layer and a background layer.\n\nDestructable Layer\n\nIndestructable Layer\nThere is also a \"destroyed mask\" that is used to create areas at the start that have already been destroyed. This is mainly used so that you dont have to burrow for ages at the start to get to your opposition. Combined together you end up with the final result below.\n\nDestroyed Mask\n\nFinal Result\nEach texture layer at the moment is 2048x2048 (which is the maximum texture resolution the 360 supports) and is in the format Color (8bpp). The indestructable and the destructable layer are then sent to the GPU for use in rendering and particle collisions by the GPU particle system.\nObjects such as players and weapons that are updated by the CPU however cannot perform collision checks on a texture that is on the GPU (without calling getData() which causes read-back which is horribly slow). So the destructable and the instructable layers are duplicated in the initial load of the level and saved as a large two dimensional array of Colors on the CPU.\nYou may ask why wa\n\nKeywords: ",

I ran into many problems, the majority of which were due to the different ways render targets work on the 360 and the fact that you cant use 128bit floating point textures (Vector4 textures).\nIll be going into more depth on the problems i faced on the 360 in a different post. But what i can say is that it works almost perfectly on the 360 now and im very happy with it.\nFor now you can see a new video of the engine with some fancy bloom effects added :)\n\nKeywords: ",

It turns on, the lights come on but it doesnt do anything, doesnt even get to the bios screen, nothing.\n\nWhats odd about this is the fact that my backup PC (some crappy little machine i have lying around and have been using as a media PC recently) broke on the same day, with the same problem!

Despite the great stats regarding the number of uploads and views and user engagement, without the poster sales we are unable to keep funding the AWS servers and store the 90GB+ of images that users have uploaded.\nDeveloping Printomi has been a great roller coaster ride of a project. It has been hard work, months of late nights to get things into a shape and despite the fact that less than two months later we decided to shut it all down I still think it was worth it. I am proud of what we accomplished with Printomi and hope that during its short time live others enjoyed what we created.\nI am determined not to get downhearted, instead to grow and learn from the many lessons learnt here. Some things worked and others didnt, but it was all good experience. Printomi's mistakes are all about driving me onto the next, bigger, better thing.\n\nKeywords: ",

    "prompt": "Blog Post: Well i havent updated in a while one the TD project, not because I wasnt working on anything but mainly because i have been struggling with the nuts and bolts of 3D RTS game development.\n\nNormal game development is fine when you only expect ever to have your game to simply run. When you want to make it run as a game but also act as a tool at the same time you have problems. The way the TD project is structured we have a game \"Engine\" project that contains all the code to display our objects on the screen, then we have a \"Tool\" project that contains all the code for making maps, it creates an instance of the Engine so that it can render those objects. We also have a \"Game\" project that will be the actual game and will contain all the other game type logic like menu systems etc.\nGetting all these to work nice and happily and in an efficient way is proving to be umm difficult. The problem is confounded by the fact that the tool requires multiple rendering windows to display things at once, causing me to redesign alot of the way the game works. When you only have one window open you can set classes to be static all over the place, but if you need those classes to interact in a non static way then you have to use managers to sort out how they should interact, introducing more complexity nightmares!\nBut anyways, enough of that. Time for pretty pictures:\n\nAs you can see Mr Graham 'Golden' Furner has been making good progress on his terrain generation algorithm for the project. Hopefully I will beable to get enough of the structure in place so we can begin to merge the two parts of the project together!\n\nKeywords: ",

On the left hand side you have a list of \"library blueprints\" these are loaded from an XML document. Library blueprints can then be dragged over to the second half which is where all the blueprints that are used in the map are stored.\nIf you select a blueprint you can then click a button to open the BlueprintEditor. The editor is a separate window with a rotating view of the current model for the blueprint and on the right is a property grid that lets the user edit any number of properties a blueprint has.\nSo you can see that when a user creates a map they are going to require blueprints. Blueprints can be anything from creeps, towers, trees, houses, anything. Blueprints are the actual objects that that you place in the world and interact with.\nTomorrow will be more work on the blueprint editor me thinks :D\nMike\n\nKeywords: ",

Im trying to emulate some work I did years ago in XNA, on the LieroXNA project.\nIt uses the same techniques for updating and rendering particles entirely on the GPU as my previous post. What that means is that is possible have millions of particles interacting updating and rendering simultaneously as all the operations are performed on the GPU.\nWhat I have added this time is another texture for the particles to collide with as they move. I was originally working with the same dirt and grass texture as my XNA project but I thought as it was Halloween I would get into the spirit a little ;)\nThere are several options on the right hand side that can be used to tweak the properties of the simulation. I spent alot of time playing around with these, there are some really cool effects you can achieve with just simple modifications.\nThere are so many things I could add to improve this. You can see some of them in a video I made years ago:\n\nThere we have some cool stuff like Bloom, forces and multiple rendering layers going on. It would be nice to get those in this sample too.\nFor now however I think im going to have a break from this sample. I have spent quite a few weeks to get to this point so far, and I think I need a break for a little bit so I can work on other things.

Each picture can be clicked to see a larger version and comment / like.\n\nAfter 10 days up in the chilly hills I was looking forward to getting down to the coast and enjoying some of the sun and beach again. First up was the ancient colonial town of Cartagena. This place is a dichotomy of poverty and wealth thanks to the large number of western tourists that visit the city.\n\n\n\nThe first couple of days I stayed in a party hostel and so spent most of my time drinking and not sleeping. I did take a break at one point though to visit the famous 'Mud Volcano'.\n\nInside of it is a big hole that at the bottom is filled with mud. You ease your self down a mud slicked ladder until you reach the grey goop.\n\nThere were already a load of people wallowing around when I got in. It was almost impossible to move in there so you had to grab onto whatever body part is available to move yourself about.\nApparently the mud goes down for 2km into the earth. The mud was so buoyant that I couldn't actually go down to see how far it went. I did stick my head under though which in hindsight was a poor idea as my hands were covered in mud too so I couldn't remove the insidious stuff from my eyes and mouth.\n\nAfter the parties I decided I needed to rest for a little while so I shut myself away in a hotel. I spent the days chilling out and exploring more of the city. On the sunday I walked along the wall to watch the sunset and watch hundreds of people flying kites.\n\n\nAfter my days of solitude I was ready to enter the fray again. This time I had chosen a different hostel called the Calamari which turned out to have the nicest dorm room I had ever stayed in.\n\n\nIn the evening I went out to meet Anna my German friend from the San Blas \n\nKeywords: ",

The reason for this is that I have been trying to decide whether to progress with it atall. I believe it is an awesome project and will be successful, however each time I complete something in the project it adds to the complexity never subtracting from the amount of work remaining.\n\nI finally however decided that I would stick it out as my mantra goes \"Your success is only measured by your accomplishments\". If I constantly keep starting new projects then I will never accomplish anything and therefore never be successful.\nI had a long chat with my new friend Ebor Jan Folkertsma about different technical challenges associated with developing a tool and a game engine in tandem. The chat was extremely useful in the fact that it allowed me to take a more objective view of the project and split it down into simple tasks rather than getting swamped by the enormity of the project. It also made me feel like I wasn't sailing into uncharted waters, there were others out there that had run into similar problems and had come up with solutions to solve it. Basically Ebor gave me a big morale boost which encouraged me to stick with this project.\nSo onto the progress. Well as I said not a whole lot of visible progress has been made, I have mostly been re-organising the core of the project again to best suit my needs. I have however been adding more functionality allowing the user to place objects on the level in preparation for setting triggers and the like later down the road.\n\nNext step in the project is picking so that the new objects on the map can be selected and have their properties modified and triggers added and the such :)\n\nKeywords: ",

I was a little worried about the terms of service but I assumed as they had been on there for years already then must be fine.\n3 days after launch I received this email from Google:\n\nNeedless to say I was shocked, worried, upset and annoyed. Not only was Credit Redeemer taken down but my entire Google Play Developer account terminated including Mr Nibbles, Mr Nibbles Forever and Ectoplasm.\n\nI of course immediately appealed stating that I wasn't aware of any previous violations and asking for more information. Surely it must be some sort of mistake? 3 days later I get the following:\n\nWow okay so now I am really worried. It seems like it's a robotic reply, even if \"Bruce\" is a real person he certainly hasn't read what I said in the appeal and hasn't offered any more information or reason for the lack of extra information.\nAt this point I decided to dig back through my inbox looking for previous mentions to Google Play and violation. The only thing I could find was from 2 years ago when I received what I believed to be warnings regarding an OpenSSL vulnerability in the AirSDK.\nI didnt action on the error as it was for Ectoplasm, a hackathon project, plus I was travelling at the time, I assumed that it would just be automatically disabled.

I agreed that it could get a little distracting so I added the option to disable the bars.\n\nWhile I was there I also added a couple of command line arguments to the app so that you could configure each instance from a shortcut.\nThe options are:\n-bars [true/false]\nThis tells the app to startup with the bars enabled or not, the default is true.\n-type [cpu/mem/net]\nThis tells which of the three monitors the app should start up with, cpu, memory or network.\nOne way to get all three to start with different monitors when windows startup would be to use the statup folder in windows.\n1) Click the windows start icon, then right click on \"all programs\" and click open:\n\n2) Navigate to Programs > Startup then make three shortcuts to Windows Taskbar Monitor v0.3 you can rename the shortcuts if you like:\n\n3) For each shortcut, right click and select properties:\n\n4) Now enter your command line arguments in the Target field after the final .exe:\n\nEt voilà when windows starts you should now have three different monitors opening!\nI have pushed all the source code and the new binary files to my google code project: https://code.google.com/p/win7-taskbar-mon/\nEnjoy!\n\nKeywords: ",

I tried about 100 different things to fix it including deleting my entire website and then reinstalling! Well I still havent got the embedding sorted but atleast the website formatting is back to normal now.\nOh I changed the skin too, to this very sexy one by [MangoOrange™](https://www.mangoorange.com/).\n\nKeywords: ",

    "prompt": "Blog Post: Worms two was the third project I undertook during my stay at Rockpool Games and was certainly the one i got most excited about. It was a tough project with extremely tough deadlines.\n\nThere were two coders, one being myself, and an artist on the project. It was coded in J2ME and ported to multiple handsets. I enjoyed parts of the project, such as the random level generation algorithm and the particle system, however the majority of the time was spent wrestling with bugs that only appeared on one or two handsets\nDespite this it was phenominally successfull scoring game of the month as Orange Mobile and getting a perfect 10/10 score from the Total Mobile Magazine\n\nWorms_Total Mobile.pdf\n\nKeywords: ",

    "prompt": "Blog Post: Well its that time again. XNA 2.0 has been released and with it a new Dream Build Play competition.\n\nAs a warm up to the competition Microsoft have launched a smaller contest named Silicon Minds. The central idea behind this contest is to encourage A.I. in games and as such 60% of the marks will be given to the quality of the AI in the game a further 20% given to how fun the game is and a final 20% given to the polish of the game.\nI have been wracking my brain trying to think of a good project to do for this contest, some of the ideas i came up with were:\n\nBee Swarm Game\nDynamic FPS Difficulty\nParticle Flocking\nLearning Geometry Wars\nPredictive Multiplayer\nAdaptive Level Design\nDNA Designer\nDesign a Positronic Brain\n\nIn the end i decided that due to how short the competition is (ends jan 27th) and my lack of any A.I. experience I would stick with what I have learnt in the past and develop on that. So using the work i have done on LieroXNA so far im planning on writing an A.I. for a deformable 2d landscape.\nSorry i cant say any more at this stage but stay tuned and ill update in the near future.\n\nKeywords: ",

    "title": "XNAGPUParticles (1,000,000 Dynamic Particles)",
    "prompt": "Blog Post: This is another submission of work i have done in my final year. This time the project is all my own work.\nThe project is a continuation based on work from before Christmas and is an experiment into state preserving particle systems. I started out with examining the basic particle systems such as a static system and one that updates on the CPU. I then moved onto more advanced systems such as the GPU based system described by Lance Latta and others. I soon discovered however that XNA doesn't support \"uber buffers\" and as such had to invent a new solution using vertex textures. The result is a particle system written in XNA that is able to update and render 1,000,000 particles at about 22 frames a second with 4 forces.\n\nTo view this demo you first need to have the XNA runtimes. If you dont have those just go HERE.\nOnce installed you can grab the binary for this project https://www.mikecann.co.uk/Work/XNAGPUParticles.zip\nIf you are interested in seeing the source code for this project, just drop me an email: mike.cann@gmail.com\nOh also, the written report for this can be found https://www.mikecann.co.uk/Work/GPUParticles2003.doc\n\nKeywords: ",

Currently the algorithm is very rough as you can see from the video there are still some problems that cause the particle to behave a little… umm.. erratic ;)\nHopefully with abit more time and effort ill get it sorted. At the moment there are 5000 interacting particle on one CPU, hopefully i will beable to push that figue up soon and take advantage of my quad-core system :)\n\nKeywords: ",
